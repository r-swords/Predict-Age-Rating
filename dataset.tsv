In the beginning, Andy sees his wife cheating. Three seconds of mild thrusting, fully clothed and shown from the shoulders up. New prisoners are brought into the prison nude. Bare buttocks are seen. There may be brief glimpses of genitals. There's some sexual dialogue present between the prisoners. A bare buttock visible during herd shower scene Brief male nudity (Buttocks), suggestive posters hanging on walls, a make out scene and prison rape that isn't shown but heavily implied. The main character is referenced to getting in a ""routine"" in which he is prison raped by a gang of men. The act is never shown but it is heavily implied by showing the men approach Andy. The actual nudity is very limited, brief male rear nudity is shown in the showers a few times and if you look extremely closely you can make out a few nude posters on the wall. The group that routinely gang rapes the protagonist references oral sex during an assault by telling the main character he will swallow whatever he's given to swallow. Nothing is shown onscreen. Pictures of girls show some of their bodies naked in the cell In one scene you could see bloody gun shots on a man. There is a shirt on him so you don't see the injury. A man is shot 4 times very quickly in the chest, the blood is seen and after we see him laying on the ground In a pool of blood. A narration implies that rape is an occurrence for Andy. One scene involves the same men who usually terrorize him punching and kicking him against the ground and says he will put his penis in Andy's mouth to which Andy replies they shouldn't do that. Non graphic. A man hits two others in the face with a film roll. He is then punched twice in the chest and once across the jaw (a dot of blood on his mouth). Shortly after, he is kicked four times in the stomach and hit across the face twice (seen from a distance). We then hear he spent a month in the infirmary. A man is hit five times and kicked once. He tries to crawl away, but is dragged offscreen and is implied to be still beaten up. He is then seen injured and bruised in a wheelchair for a few seconds and we hear he spent the rest of his life in a hospital. Not for kids. A man tries to fend off a few people in a fight and is beaten offscreen. It's also briefly referenced that he was raped. He then walks with a few bruises seen shortly on his face. A man is beaten up by a prison guard, with 12 blows landing. No blood or injuries are visible due to the dark lighting, most of the blows are offscreen. It is later revealed that he died from his injuries. One man holds a knife to another man's throat, a tiny wound is seen on his neck. A man says he can get people 'reefers' (no other interaction or any smoking or using it however at all) Men drink beer after along days work . And a prisoner gets cigarettes for his fellow inmates. People drink beer on a rooftop in one particular scene. One man is drunk and he holds a whiskey bottle in his hands. People smoke in several scenes. Prisoners deal cigarettes secretly among the bedsheets. The movie can be sometimes harsh and dark in tone. Prisoners torment and verbally attack new people who've just arrived, their reactions can be a bit difficult to watch as they scream and cry. M12+ The beatings may be intense to many. There are moments of moderate threat when characters are threatened (normally by guards). The prison rape elements could be distressing but, it is never shown just vaguely implied and briefly referenced. ""Christ"" is blasphemed early on in the movie. 34 uses of ""fuck"" (2 being ""motherfucker""), 3 uses each of ""dick"" and ""prick"", 2 uses of bastard, 42 uses of ""shit"" including 6 uses of ""bullshit"", 2 uses of ""shit head"" and 2 uses of ""horse shit"".

No nudity shown. The scene stops almost instantly (very brief) There are a few sexual references. There is a romantic scene where first the man and woman kiss each other (woman has her cleavage revealing) then slowly she takes off her top and her entire breast including nipples is visible about a second. It's at the center of the scene and very obvious but brief. A clothed sex scene lasts about five seconds, but there is no nudity. A woman makes a hand gesture implying her husband has a large penis, this may fly over some viewers' heads. Someone thrusts into his mistress against a door. There is loud moaning. Lots of shootings, usually not that graphic. The violence is pretty moderate. It mostly just includes shootings with some blood shown. The famous ""mattresses"" montage sequence features various newspapers with real-life photographs of killings of gangsters and mobsters. Although they a quite brief and relatively unimportant to the plot, the idea that those are real events and not pictures taken for the film might be a bit disturbing. Some of the shootings may catch you off guard with how little blood there is compared to modern day films, while there is blood often times it's no more than a little drizzle. While there is blood, shootings, fights, and stabbings it's not as constant as it seems. A man is shot four times by another man through a glass door. A bullet wound and later some blood on the glass is briefly seen. A man and woman in bed are shot to death with machine guns and blood spraying, bullet wounds are visible. The scene lasts a couple seconds. A man is stabbed in the hand and then garroted, a trickle of blood is seen on his hand. Lasts for roughly 18 seconds before the scene cuts. A man is shot in the eye, he slumps down dead. We see his glasses crack, and blood streaming for a second. Not too graphic. A man shoots two men, one in the head (we briefly see a bullet hole and red mist shooting from it), the other in the neck, then head with blood dripping from the bullet hole for two seconds. A man is shot five times in the back (from a distance), a dripping bullet wound is shown for a second or two. A man is shot dead in a car (not visible), a bullet hole in his head with blood trickling down is then seen for several seconds. Three men are shot by a policeman imposter; they die. Some blood is around two of the bodies briefly and a bullet wound dripping blood is shown on a man's back for two seconds. A man is punched once. He is then seen with a rather swollen face and subtle black eye. Some of the movie's plot is centered around drugs and drug dealing. But no actual activity is shown with drugs Some casual smoking and drinking. A minor theme of drug trafficking is present in the movie. It is presented as a lucrative, but dirty, dangerous business. Also, the issue of child drug use is briefly raised, and the Commission (the Sicilian American Mafia's top organization) decides not to deal in drugs near schools to avoid it. The depiction of domestic violence in the movie is very intense and can be upsetting. The overall tone of the movie is very dark and depressing, especially during the latter half. Multiple major character deaths that may upset some viewers. Although almost every character is a criminal some deaths may still be emotional. Some of the assassinations are intense, the tollbooth and revolving-door shootings especially. Two uses of the word ""Vaffanculo"", Italian for ""F you"". 7 uses of ""goddamn"". 7 uses of 'bitch', 5 of 'ass' (nonsexual), 3 of 'bastard', and 1 of 'dick' and 'crap'. Also 1 use of 'piece of ass' and 'banging' in a sexual context. And some racial slurs (mainly against Italians, but towards other races also; this includes two uses of the n word)."

Played for laughs and very subtle. There are extremely pervasive and frightening moments of menace, and threats, primarily by the main antagonist of The Joker, who wears horrific clown make-up to scare people and to hide the graphic scars on his cheeks. It is implied that the Joker has the remaining mob boss killed and fed to his own dogs before taking his place. Two-Face hits a girl when deciding not to kill her. As Batman is fighting the Joker and his henchmen, the Joker has a hidden knife blade in the toe of his shoe witch he uses to kick Batman in the rib the scene. This then cuts to Batman shouting in pain before throwing the Joker to the floor. Frequent and prolonged scenes of violence throughout. There are multiple shootings, stabbings, fistfights, explosions, bombings, and burnings. However the violence is only of a moderate quality and never bloody or gory. The Joker slams a pencil into a man's eye brutally. No blood or gore shown. A building is blown up Apart from Harvey Dent's scarred face, there is no blood or gore that is visibly seen throughout the entire film. There is a scene where it is implied that the Joker slashes the cheeks of another man in a Glasgow smile/Chelsea grin. We see nothing as the camera cuts away as it happens, but the actions are quite clear nonetheless. A man is shown hanging from a noose in front of a window in a ""jump"" scene, and he is already dead when he is dropped. A man is bitten and another is mauled by a dog, there is blood shown later during the first and the second doesn't show any at all. A man suffers intense burns to one side of his face, later the muscle and bone are visible in areas and his eyelid is burned away to expose his whole eyeball. A woman dies in a flaming explosion. The camera cuts to show the outside and the building blowing up so we see nothing of her death. There is a scene in which a man is shown to have a bomb sewn under his skin. When it later explodes although the camera cuts to show the explosion from another window, and the man can still be been seen blowing up into a blood red smoke cloud. A man has his legs broken, after being dropped from a small height. The breaking is audible and you see his legs crumple under him. Despite the nature of these scenes, there is no real gore and there is very, very little blood. However, the violence is discussed openly, and the Joker, who's the main perpetrator, often boasts or explains the violence graphically. He also declares that people will die and brutally murders several in quick succession. We see a drug dealer (No on-screen drugs though) Somebody is smoking a cigar. And some people drink (not focused on at all) There is a scene where a man is about to drink, but is interrupted. A man quickly drinks two shots of whiskey. A drug dealer is displeased with the man who supplies his trade. The drugs are indicated to have been laced with a hallucinogenic and a man is shown suffering from intense hallucinations and calling out in terror on the floor. We see nothing but him thrashing and the drugs themselves are not shown, only mentioned. We see a mobster constantly smoke a cigar, smoking in almost every scene he appears in. A dead man is seen hanging briefly. The Joker tells two upsetting stories of how he got his scars. Two Face threatens to blow up a house. The iconic Joker interrogation scene can disturb viewers. The Joker taunts Two-Face, encouraging him to kill himself. Two-Face's descent into madness is chilling and may be difficult to watch for some viewers. The appearances of the super-villains in the film can be disturbing. The Scarecrow's burlap mask is creepy, and Two-Face's scarred face is gruesome. Of course, the Joker's makeup and Glasgow smile are extremely scary, especially for younger viewers. The Joker's bizarre, nihilistic personality is terrifying. The rubber clown-masks of the Joker goons are mildly frightening. The ending can be very intense for some. The film's tone is very dark and gritty. Almost every scene with Joker is pretty Intense but isn't so scary you'll be afraid to watch. The Jokers eerie laugh and constant salacious licking of his lips is unsettling. Batman and a cop race to rescue two hostages. A few uses of ''hell'', ''damn'', ''son of a b*tch"" and ""ass""."

A man's buttocks are briefly shown. It is implied that a woman was with a trafficked victim while she lays on the bed, completely covered with a blanket. Characters attend a show in Cuba, a man on stage is wearing a red cape with his back towards the audience, he drops his cape but the camera is on the audience and nothing is shown. The audience are shocked at the man in red cape and their discussion implies he has an incredibly large penis. While violent, much of the movies violence is either shown quickly or offscreen. The movie isn't disturbing A young man is shot. The shooting is offscreen, but he is later shown lying down with streams of blood visible. A character puts a gun in a person's mouth and shoots it. A bit brutal but milder than it sounds Two men are seen lying dead in a stream with blood near them A man is strangled A prostitute is found dead in a bed. Her clothes are stained with blood. Two men die in a bombing, which sprays blood onto a window. Their bodies are not visible. A man kills himself, we don't see him do it but we see a quick glimpse of blood around him A man stabs another we see some blood A man is shot in the chest. No blood shown A man is shot several times with blood spurts A man commits suicide by slitting his wrists while in a bathtub, we see the aftermath of this with blood on the floor and in the bath. A man is shot, offscreen, at point-blank range. People are seen casually drinking and smoking throughout the film. A man is seen taking pills from a prescription pill bottle. Many people are shot and stabbed but none of it is disturbing some strong graphic violence and language, and brief drug content The assassinations can be intense, a litte bit more violent than in the first.

During this scene, their breasts, buttocks, and pubic hair is visible. The nudity in this movie is mostly non sexual nudity and is full frontal and rear of mostly females with only a couple quick glimpses of full frontal males; 4 to 5 scenes that show topless women. This film does show nudity, but a lot of it is non-sexual and shows what the Holocaust was actually like. The nudity is even briefer due to the black and white coloring except when focused on womens breast's and women removing clothes to shower. A woman is shown removing her dress with nothing underneath as the camera shows her breasts and pubic area for quite a while while women around her get undressed. Men and women take off their clothes and run in circles and men are forced to do ""squats"" to humiliate them as their penises are shown. A woman lies in Goeth's bed. Her breasts are clearly seen in various shots each lasting for 5-10 seconds. A man kisses one woman after another A woman wears a shirt that allows the form of her nipples to be seen at times. A man grabs a woman's clothed breast against her will. A man kisses a woman who does not want to be kissed Many Jewish prisoners are seen being forced to strip, run, and be examined. Full-frontal nudity of both women and men. Most times, the nudity is shown quite briefly. Oskar's mistress is reclining on the bed, and her breasts are seen and as she sits up she is wearing very loose and flimsy short shorts and the crack of her vagina is clearly shown. Lots of scenes of Nazis murdering innocent people and multiple scenes of brutality against innocent people. One of the most realistic and true to life depictions of violence in cinematic history A woman engineer is shot in back of her head after arguing about a building's structure with a Nazi officer. Blood flow is seen on the ground. A Nazi officer and his men confront a group of Jewish prisoners over a stolen chicken. When no one talks, he and one of his men shoot one of them at point blank range in the stomach and shoots the man a second time in the head; blood is seen pooling from his head. As the officer is about to shoot another one, a young boy steps up claiming that the dead man is the culprit. Although this movie doesn't contain a bunch of over-the-top blood and gore its still very disturbing since you see tons of innocent people getting senselessly murdered including children.. There is a sequence that lasts roughly three minutes that depicts the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto. The sequence shows dozens of Jews being executed, however, unlike most executions in the film, barely any blood or gore is shown. The film presents a horrific, stomach-wrenching depiction of the holocaust: many, many people are seen being killed in one form or another. They are shot at point blank range, children are slaughtered, many more are killed in gas chambers. It is the kind of violence that stays with one for a long time. It is VERY, very disturbing because it is not only graphic, but also very realistic. A one-armed man struggles to shovel snow. Two Nazis shoot him; blood is seen pooling on the ground. A woman is shot through the back of the head, shown from a distance. A small bullet wound hole is shown, with blood briefly spurting and pouring on the ground. A man is pulled away from the other Jews leaving their homes, and is shot in the back of the head; the top of his head explodes and tears apart, blood pools and spurts around him. A man with an ill wife tries to tell a Nazi about her condition. Instead, she is shot in the head. Blood splatters on the man's face from the shot, and spurts from the wife's head while the man cries. A group of people hiding in a bedroom are shot (including children), one by one. The shots are offscreen, as a German Nazi official plays a cheery tune on the piano. A man wakes up and nonchalantly executes Jews through a window with a sniper rifle. When a man deems a worker to be unproductive, he marches him outside and attempts to execute him. However, despite trying two pistols, both mechanisms jam and he ends up beating the worker instead. A pile of bloody bodies is seen outside a building. A group of hospital patients are executed by Nazis with machine guns. The nurses give out cyanide to patients so they don't die from being shot. A man intimidates a young woman; she cries, and then he beats her. He pushes a shelf of wine on top of her, but she is not killed. A soldier shoots a little boy in the chest while two other soldiers hold the boy up. There is no blood: only feathers from his jacket. Dead bodies are dug up to be burned. There is a heap of them already being incinerated. Several characters are seen drinking alcoholic beverages. One character is seen drunk in a few scenes. Smoking is frequently shown. Multiple nude corpses are shown going up a conveyor belt into a burning pile of other dead bodies. A potentially mentally ill nazi officer fires a pistol into the pile of the corpses. Half of the movie focuses on how the Jews died during the Holocaust unexpectedly which can be really sad and emotionally intense The ending can be very emotional for some. This movie isn't particularly scary, just very distrubing, violent, and tragic. Woman and children emotionally upset and scared for their lives. The sequence of the ghetto being liquidated contains continual violence, which viewers could find emotionally disturbing. The sequence of a worker surviving an attempted execution by Amon Goeth is suspenseful. This film depicts the Holocaust and it delves deeply into the horrors of war. Because of its subject matter, it can be emotionally taxing and difficult to watch. 8 uses of f**k, 2 uses of b***h, and 1 use each of h*ll, b*****d, and p***k"

The film is dominated by large scale battles We see the aftermath of a battle. The battlefield is covered in dead bodies, some with spears or arrows sticking in them. We briefly see one dead man with his arm severed--we can see his arm lying next to him and his bloody stub--blood soaks the ground. The camera moves away and it is for at most a second. The enemy catapults human heads into Minas Tirith. We see somewhat closeups of the bloody heads and their severed necks. A Lord catches on fire, is engulfed in flames, and jumps off of the castle to his death. Two characters fight. They punch, kick and bite each other. One character has his finger viciously bitten off by another character. Blood runs and oozes out. In the Extended edition a man walks out of the black gate he is wearing a mask but he has cuts around his mouth and a little dried blood. A man then angrily decapitates him, we see the head roll (no blood), though we do see blood on the man's sword. A party is shown where various characters drink beer or ale, and get very drunk. A character gets so drunk he passes out. A lot of characters smoke pipes, and one character coughs once or twice as a result. Gollum's transformation in the opening scene of the film is may be unsettling and lasts two minutes, though it is not upsetting or emotionally intense. The long, violent battlefield sequences are quite scary as the heroes are always under threat of death or serious injury. A trio of characters journey through ""The Paths of the Dead"" and encounter ghosts. Frodo gets attacked by a giant spider while Sam battles against it and it's very intense (these sequences can especially frighten those who suffer from arachnophobia). The spider also moves very quickly which makes the scene all the more intense The Witch-King scenes may be frightening for some. Two of the characters descend into violent madness. The first of these is marked by a transformation into a creepy creature. That scene is particularly intense. Gollum's appearance and voice can be frightening. This is a rather violent movie but not much blood/gore is shown. It has a fantasy overtone to it. The ending of the film is emotionally intense.

Jules and Vincent shower outside. We only see them from the waist up. Butch and his girlfriend are kissing and Butch moves off-camera. Oral sex is implied. After this Butch takes a shower. He is nude, but nothing from the waist down is shown. The Gimp wears a leather suit implied to be a sex suit. But this suit isn't revealing at all. A lot of sexual references with crude, vulgar terms. Two girls are talking about piercings, one of them mentions that she has a piercing on her genitals. A man suddenly shoots another man without warning. No blood. Most violent scenes aren't that graphic. However there are a few particular parts which are. Most notably the scene in which a man is shot in the head while sitting in a car and there's a large explosion of blood and the car and people in it get covered with blood and brain matter. They later spend a scene cleaning it up. The needle scene and rape scene are also pretty brutal. A man injects heroin into his arm. It shows the needle slowly piercing and entering his skin in closeup and then as the blood fills up the syringe. This is all shown for a lengthy amount of time and might make some viewers squirm. There is a scene where a man is gagged and raped by another man. You briefly see thrusting but this is mostly offscreen, although it's still explicit and is probably the most violent scene in the movie. A man is riddled with a submachine gun. The shooting is seen very briefly, and the aftermath is shown with the man's corpse covered in blood and bullet holes, with some blood splattered on the wall. A man punches another man hard in the face, and knocking him out. A man is shot several times and screams offscreen as a result, this scene is then shown again but is onscreen, blood spurts are visible and screams are audible. A woman snorts a drug and gets a nosebleed as a result. A man chases another and shoots another man several times (but misses); he accidentally shoots an innocent woman. Blood squirts out of her leg A man is whipped in the face with the butt of a shotgun. A man is shot in the groin with a shotgun; a chunk of blood is briefly visible. He is then shown on the floor in pain. A man is sliced across the chest with a large katana (offscreen), a large streak of blood is visible, he is then killed by being stabbed in the chest. Frequent cigarette smoking. Two men have a lengthy discussion about how hash is legal in Amsterdam. A man buys heroin from his friend. He then describes how the heroin makes you high, when you use it, where it comes from and how much it costs. One man briefly smokes marijuana using a joint and a woman uses a bong. Some casual drinking. A woman uses a credit card to get some cocaine ready to snort however the use of the drug is not shown but implied. A woman goes into a bathroom and puts her head down (off camera) and we hear her snorting something (cocaine) there are several other women doing the same thing, she then pulls her head up and has a bit of cocaine underneath her nose which she wipes. Almost all of the drug use ends up backfiring against whoever uses it. The drug use though is very explicit, especially the heroin scene which is shown in extremely graphic detail and for an extended period of time. A man graphically prepares and injects heroin and a woman mistakes it for cocaine and snorts some. She collapses and nearly dies before getting an adrenaline shot to the heart. Some might find the violence in the movie disturbing or distasteful. The film's shootings and killings aren't very disturbing as they are stylized, unless you're very sensitive. Some moments in the film are played for black comedy, but they are still pretty intense. This movie is disturbing at some points Some slurs for Koreans, Vietnamese, and Mexicans are heard in the beginning. Virtually every single character in the movie regularly uses harsh language. Samuel L Jackson's character probably says the most though. Language is used very commonly throughout, it's a part of these characters' daily conversation. 265 uses of ""fuck"" including 46 uses of ""motherfucker"", 94 uses of ""shit"", 61 uses of ""ass"", 35 uses of ""damn"", 54 uses of ""bitch"", 42 uses of ""nigga"", 2 uses of ""prick"", 2 uses of ""dick"", 7 use of ""pussy."""

A bunch of twisted slimy dwarf skeletons. The movie begins with scenes from a vast battle, during which elves and men do battle with Sauron and his forces. The violence is more stylized than graphic. Almost no blood is seen. However, a great deal of medieval weapons are visible during this scene, and corpses are strewn all over. It looks more like they are hitting them with the swords, but there is arrow shooting. Then Sauron hits men and elves with his mace. They go flying, but there is no blood. During a one on-one fight between the leader of the men and the dark lord, the man is flung against rocks and dies with a bloody (but not gory) cut on his head. Another man then uses the sword of the fallen leader to cut off Sauron's fingers, and remove the ring. However, this is not gory, as there is fire and smoke instead of blood. Sauron then disintegrates into a pile of ashes and sends a shock wave across the field obliterating the rest of both armies. The scene in which Sauron's fingers are cut off is shown a few more times during the course of the three films. This flashback culminates with a scene in which there is some more fighting similar to the big battle. A man dives into a river and then is shot by archers. We do not see the impact, but the man is seen floating dead with several arrows protruding from his back, and some diluted blood can be seen in the water. Two elderly men fight using long sticks that emit bolts of power. They are both knocked to the ground, and flung about. By the end, they both have bloody faces. One is magically forced to rotate while lying on the floor, with his fixed head being the central point of rotation. An innocent hobbit strolling down a street has his head lopped off by a Nazgul (non-graphic). The scene cuts away on impact. One of the main characters is stabbed in the shoulder by one of the Nazgul. He screams. We see him later, near death, with a bloody wound. There is a battle in a cavern involving the heroes, orcs, and a troll. This battle is mostly non-graphic swordplay with the exception of two points. The first is when a man removes the head of an orc, and there is a small splash of black blood. The second is when the troll is shot through the mouth; again, there is little to no blood, but the arrows are shown protruding from the back of the creature's head, and from its mouth. A man is repeatedly shot with arrows. We see the impact, and he grunts in pain. He is shot three times in total. An uruk then prepares to shoot him in the head, but he is interrupted by another character. The Hobbits drink a lot of ale, and some get drunk. One scene at a bar where seveal people are drinking alcohol. Several people there are very drunk. A lot of characters smoke pipes. Gandalf and Bilbo are seen smoking pipes. When Frodo and friends go to a bar to hide from Nazgul the people that are inside are seen drinking a lot and some are getting drunk. Gandalf leans over to pick up the ring and a very sudden flash of the eye with a loud noise happens. May startle many. As the fellowship are crossing the bridge of Khazad Doom, they arrive at a part of the bridge that is in the process of crumbling, and they barely make it across before the section of bridge crumbles completely and falls down into the abyss. A quick shot of a spider and a many-legged bug when the hobbits are hiding from a ringwraith In the orc place all the orcs dig for another orc which is intense. There are a couple of jump moments. A scene in which a friendly character's face briefly turns grotesque suddenly and without warning. The change is accompanied by a loud snarl from the character, but he returns back to how he was crying. Another jump scene involves a character hiding behind a pillar, when suddenly, a much larger creature goes around the other side of the pillar and roars loudly. The Nazgul are evil creatures that are cloaked all in black, and that give off a bloodcurdling cry from time to time. The formation of Lurtz is grotesque. Some may find it disturbing. The facial appearance of the Orcs could be scary. The faces of the orcs are cut up and a little bloody with yellow eyes and gray skin. Most of the battle sequences are intense. There is one scene with a gigantic, flaming, demon-like creature, called a Balrog. An enormous squid-like creature with numerous tentacles and razor sharp teeth attacks the Fellowship. There is one brief scene in which a creature is tortured. This may be disturbing for younger viewers. The creature's screams can be heard and his hands are visible, but nothing graphic is shown. When a man is affected by the ring, he becomes irrational and gets somewhat scary, shouting and grabbing other characters.

No sex or female nudity are shown. No explicit sexual content/nudity is displayed in the film. There is one scene of brief male nudity. Only a part of his butt is shown. One man is seen with many wounds on his chest, arms, and legs. Blood is clearly visible. Later, when a doctor tries to stop the bleeding with cotton weed pads, the blood, that soaks the pads is seen. An interrogator attempts to gouge out a man's eyes, but stops before any damage is done. Lots of death in this film, but hardly any gore or blood. Tuco throws a guard off the moving train and repeatedly hits the back of his head on a rock. The interrogation scene is probably the most violent part of the movie A man is violently beaten during an interrogation, with some blood shown. A woman is beaten and we can see blood on her lip. Some scenes of soldiers bleeding mild to moderately with bullet wounds in the chest area. A man is shot four times in the face through a pillow; nothing is heard and only a steaming hole in the pillow is seen. One character is bashed in the skull a few times (blood is briefly shown) and his dead body is run over by a locomotive offscreen. Numerous men are killed quickly by gunshots, some in one-on-one gun duels, others by military skirmishes and firing squads. Primarily bloodless, but corpses are often shown. Frequent tobacco use mainly cigars. Characters are shown frequently drinking and smoking throughout the film. Eastwood smokes nearly all the time in the movie. The scene between Tuco and his brother Pablo is very emotional. The movie's final minutes could be intense to some viewers. 1 ""Hijo de Puta"" which could be translated to the B word 5-6 uses of ""bastard"", 2-3 uses of ""bitch"", 1-2 uses of ""asshole"", 1 use of ""bullshit"", and 1 use of ""Goddamn""."

No graphic nudity, we only see her bare back. The outline of jenny's nipple is briefly shown as she shows forrest her breasts. There is kissing and implied sex, Jenny and Forrest kiss in a bed, lieutenant Dan is shown making out with a woman as she sits on his lap. Jenny's butt can be seen Two characters have sex off screen, but the man's moaning sounds are heard. It's implied that a child hears the sounds, which he later mocks to the man. Jenny is briefly shown in a car with a man, and they begin to make out. Forrest (not knowing what's happening), goes to stop the man thinking he's hurting her. They go inside and Jenny shows her breasts to Forrest (it's not shown). A scene in which Jenny performs as a showgirl completely naked in a bar. However, a guitar covers her breasts and vulva, though her butt can be seen sometimes Forrest's pubic hair can be seen completely A scene with prostitutes involved. Nothing explicit but it is part of the plot. Overall not a lot of violence. 90% of the violence occurs during the Vietnam chapter, explosions, gun shots, dead bodies, etc. other than that nothing else happens except (non-graphic) punching and bullying. Some mild violence in the Vietnam scene. Some brief blood and Forrest gets shot; references to it made throughout. A man slaps Jenny and Forrest beats up people who abuse/""annoy"" Jenny. Forrest finds and saves plenty of soldiers in the jungle during the Vietnam scene, and brings them to a safe area saving them. The men have blood on them, but its usually not very bad. One of the men hurts his legs so badly to the point that they had to be amputated. Real-life footage of a man being gunned down and blood seeping through his shirt is shown for a few seconds. A prolonged scene takes place during the Vietnam War in which fighter planes drop incinerator bombs on a jungle, weapons are fired, and several men are shown being shot at and blown up; lots of gunfire, explosions, and shouting (as well as some blood) is present. The actual fighting isn't graphic, but it's violently intense and results in the death of at least one man and in the dismemberment of another man's legs; we also briefly see a bloody wound on a man's stomach and a man narrating the scene says he was shot in the buttocks (we briefly see the bullet hole on his buttock when he later shows the wound to another man). Men are later seen in a hospital, where we see men on gurneys hooked up to medical equipment and in various stages of injury, some with missing limbs; one man is briefly shown with half his face covered with a blood-stained cloth. Bullies insult, throw rocks at, and chase another boy (one rock hits him in the head and we see a little bit of blood). Later, the boy is shown older and he is again chased by bullies in a car. He manages to escape from the bullies both times, unharmed the second time. Some other more violent historical events are also shown, including newsreels of George Wallace getting shot (we see some blood) and assassination attempts on Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. The assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and John Lennon are also referenced, but not shown. Several fistfights occur throughout the movie that result in bloody noses, black eyes, and other minor injuries. One such fight ensues from a man's violent reaction to a woman getting slapped across the face and knocked to the ground. The movie contains moderate drug content but nothing too explicit as the camera usually cuts off before we see the direct usage. Lt. Dan becomes an alcoholic after the war. He drinks beer constantly. One scene shows Jenny snorting coke at a party. Cigarette smoking for the time period capture. A woman is shown snorting cocaine (very briefly). It is later implied that she had just injected herself with heroin. Cigarettes are shown in an ashtray in a hotel room. One man says a woman who was kissing him tasted ""like cigarettes."" Bongs, ashtrays, bottles of pills, needles, and other drug paraphernalia are shown a couple times (we never see them being used, however). A man smokes cigarettes and drinks alcohol in several scenes. We see empty bottles of alcohol littered around his apartment. We briefly see a bottle of alcohol in a man's hand as he runs out of a house. This film is overall quite depressing The film has a fairly bittersweet ending and may leave you feeling mixed emotions. There is non-graphic war violence A war scene in Vietnam is quite violent and has gunfire, explosions, and shouting. Some bloody wounds are shown and at least one man is killed. Soldiers are later seen seriously injured, and some with missing limbs and bandaged in a hospital. A man's legs are amputated (off screen) as a result of what happened in the aforementioned Vietnam War sequence and he is for some time depicted as being bitter and depressed and as having turned to alcohol to deal with his loss. The word ""cripple"" is used offensively a few times. Goddamn is used around 20-30 times. S*** Happens Sticker Was on Someone's Car. After Forrest Gump show his Buttocks, Lyndon B Johnson Laughed and Said ""God damn Son"" I use of ""n****s"" when referring to black students The word ""Coon"" is used to describe black people Three uses of the F word, One barely heard, one said out loud, and one covered up with microphone feedback. 10 uses of the word ""shit"", one of which is in writing."

Moaning noises are heard coming from the theater. A brief picture of a penis is shown. A woman grabs a man's balls briefly A man is pistol whipped. Little blood is shown. Extremely brutal, bloody and disturbing fist-fighting scenes throughout. There are more than a dozen scenes of fighting between men, and the fighting can get extremely gruesome and savagely violent. A man's face is beaten to a bloody pulp. He struggles to breathe afterwards. This is extremely brutal and it's all shown in really close-up and slow-motion. A character's apartment explodes. A character dreams of being caught in a plane crash, with an inside view of an airplane being torn apart. A group of men hold a man hostage, pulling down his pants and duct-taping his mouth shut. They threaten to castrate him and he passes out from shock. A car crash happens when a character stops steering and allows the car to careen into oncoming traffic before crashing into a ditch. A man covers another man's hand with an acidic powder as a test of strength and slaps him repeatedly as he screams and writhes in pain. The skin starts to blister really bad and partly melts away. This is pretty graphic and the camera lingers on the injury for a while. Members of the ""Fight Club"" are told to start fights with strangers in public and they do so. A man shoots himself through the cheek. Lots of blood then gushes out from the wound and down his neck. Another man is seen with a graphic and gory bullet hole on the back of his head and he collapses, dead. Men commit acts of urban vandalism, such as blowing up a computer store and destroying a coffee shop. A character gets shot in the head by a police officer. He lays on a table, dead as he bleeds out from the back of his head. The top half of his head is missing and blood and brains spill out. Brief but very graphic. One character hits the other character's head from the floor, the scene is very brutal and gory, later this same character is seen in a film with a partially mutilated face. After most of the fight scenes characters have some bloody cuts and bruises. The main character often walks around with injuries that get more severe as the film goes on. A woman threatens suicide by overdosing on Xanax. A bottle of pills is seen a few times. Vodka and beer drinking. A woman smokes constantly, and appears in several scenes. One of the main characters says he doesn't smoke near the beginning of the film, but starts smoking later. Several scenes take place in and around bars. The film has a very dark tone throughout the film, although some moments are meant to be comedic. The whole film is extremely disturbing and psychologically crazy, as it depicts men engaging in acts of urban vandalism, fighting each other and doing other barbaric things in order to achieve to get their masculinity, whereas the Narrator slowly becomes increasingly insane as his inner demons begin to control him. This is all very unnerving and thought-provoking, but the film has a darkly comedic and satirical tone. R18+ ( Strong Violence, Strong Coarse Language & Strong Adult Themes ) 80 uses of ""f--k"".

We see his bloody gut wound, and he limps with agony. Cavalry men charge cavalry orcs. Soldiers on both sides are stabbed, speared, decapitated and limbs are hacked off. We see bloodied swords and several bodies on the ground. Thousands of cavalry riding men charge into orcs on foot. Several orcs are killed. Characters find an orc head impaled on a spear. Humans ambush another group of humans fighting for the bad guys. Several of the bad guy humans are shot with arrows and we see several dead bodies. The orcs are shown to be cannibalistic and eat their own kind, with gross and occasionally bloody results. In the extended edition, we see the aftermath of a battle at a creek, with several, bloodied dead bodies of orcs and men on the ground, with blood in the creek. Several characters smoke pipes and drink wine and ale, though they never get drunk. In a very sad/intense scene, children go to war Evil, unsympathetic orc creatures begin eating another orc, which they just decapitated, all that is seen of the act itself is an intestine flying up in the air, it is easy to miss, however this is all still pretty disturbing Armies of orcs are grotesque, with rough voices and yellow eyes and sharp teeth. A few of them have blood dripping out of their mouths. They are very frightening. The orcs are shown in several scenes. In a scene in which the main character falls into a marsh that carries the souls of dead people, we see very scary, grotesque ghosts trying to pull him in before he is instead pulled out. This scene is disturbing and very scary. The servants of Sauron are clad all in black with their faces invisible. They emit loud screams and talk with a very evil, low voice. They ride grotesque flying creatures that kill people and good guys without mercy, mostly by picking them up and letting them fall. Gollum is a frightening, frightening creature, who is present through most of the film, though he talks and interacts with main characters.

There's a long sequence where people raid a base in snowy mountains, and Two men fight and one is thrown off balcony, and he lands in a snowdrift and kills the other man. He proceeds to move around the base killing more men and placing charges, and he ultimately detonates them, causing a massive explosion. A man knocks another man off a snowmobile. There's a chase on a hill and several men chase other men on skis, firing guns at them, and a few men are knocked off their skis and roll down the hill, unconscious. Several men fire at an abandoned building, and people inside return fire, and one man blows up an attacker with a large grenade launcher. A woman throws herself off a ledge, but is not seen hitting the ground. There's a car chase shown intermittently in the middle of the film, where several men chase a van and fire weapons at it. Several cars crash, and the van flips over but lands right side up, and it continues driving. The van ultimately goes over the side of a bridge when more men shoot at it, and lands in water. A man fights another man in a hallway, though this is brief, and one of the men kills the other. Explosives are detonated in an elevator shaft, and a large explosion is seen. A group of people hold a woman while another woman stabs her (not graphic), though this is in a dream. A street starts violently exploding in a dream, and two people are killed (in the dream). Two men fight in a hotel room briefly. A few shootings with blood spray In a Dream a man is Shot in the leg blood Squirts out and Then he is Shot in the Head.This is fair suprisingly and very Hard to catch A man is shot about halfway through the movie, where we see red seep through a man's shirt as he coughs up flecks of blood. Blood is seen on his shirt for the rest of the film. Violence in Inception is tricky to tally. At times we see real men get hurt or killed. But much of the violence is perpetuated in dream worlds, where the people we see are not real, but manifestations of the subject's subconscious. As a result, the ""real"" body count is surprisingly low (at least for a film that wields this much intensity), while metaphysical fatalities run off the chart. A man takes out two men in a bathroom, shooting both of them dead. The mayhem is practically bloodless, and it's perpetrated with a certain, almost chilly, remove. There's a lengthy chase scene through city streets in another country, and a man being pursued hits several men, knocking them into things. They fire guns at him, but he evades the bullets and escapes in a car. Two men fight in a hallway during a very weird sequence in which the room turns. The fight ends when one of the men shoots the other (not graphic). People drink wine and beer. Intravenous drug sedatives and other mysterious concoctions are required to put people into these dreamlike states. A character has lost his ability to dream normally, and so he repeatedly hooks himself up to delve into his own haunting dream world. Inception is an intense movie. There are many deaths including a disturbing suicide, a high-stakes espionage plot that has an exceptionally intense ending and much more. Some concepts in the movie are potentially derealizing This film has an intense atmosphere throughout. The second half of the film is especially intense. A van drives off a bridge and slowly falls toward a river. In a dream, people hold a woman while another woman walks up and stabs her. She wakes up before you can see any harm done. This scene is unexpected and can frighten some. A woman shoots a man's leg to torture him. A train unexpectedly crashes into a car with people in it. A street starts exploding (in a dream). The action is intense at times. People die (see violence/gore). The concept of the dream-levels in the movie, and the fact that you might not be sure if the characters are dreaming or not, might frighten some viewers. At least 8 hells, 2 uses of ass (both used with ""hole""), 2 damns, 6 uses of ""Godamn,"" 3 uses of ""Jesus Christ,"" 2 of ""Jesus"" and ""My God"" and 1 use each of ""For God's sakes"" and ""God.""

Flirting and kissing between some main characters throughout the movie. A man is seen in a creature's cave, hanging upside down with a bit of blood on his face. The creature is very briefly seen eating the gory remains of another dead creature. The creature then comes over to the man to kill him, and the man visibly cuts off its arm with his lightsaber. In the Special and subsequent edition of the film, we very briefly see the creature crying out, and a bloody stump where it was injured. A large animal used as a beast of burden keels over and dies due to freezing. Han Solo uses Luke's lightsaber to cut the animal open in order to put Luke inside to keep him from freezing to death. The animal's white fleshy muscle/fat is exposed, but there is no blood. There is a large battle scene near the beginning of the film, where several uniformed combatants are killed onscreen, or are implied to have been killed. In the battle, there are three instances of a laser-firing, gigantic, robotic, elephant-like walking craft (an AT-AT ""walker"") being brought down and exploding into a fireball, killing its inhabitants. A pilot's wingman is shot dead by a laser blast from inside their fighter craft. He slumps forward, dead. When the fighter is shot down and crashes, an AT-AT ""walker"" steps on the remains of the ship, including the dead wingman, while the pilot barley escapes before the ship is crushed. The back of a man's horribly scarred head (enough to be bald) is briefly shown. There are two instances whereby Darth Vader telekinetically chokes a man to death. There is no blood, but we see them moan and struggle to breath until they slump over and die. Intense. Upon seeing Darth Vader in the dining hall in Cloud City, Han draws his laser gun and shoots at him, but Vader telekinetically draws the laser bolts to his own hand, using the Force to block/deflect them, before telekinetically pulling the gun out of the man's hand. Han is tortured offscreen, though the very first bits of the treatment (the man being placed face-first into a sparking electric device) are depicted. We hear audible screams from the outside of the closed doorway to the torture room. Han is frozen in a block of a dull-colored metallic substance, and this block is pushed to the floor. The frontal part of the man's figure, especially man's face and hands, while appearing coated in the same substance as the block, can be seen protruding from it. Not violent but intense. Not gory but ugly/horrifying. A number of Imperial stormtroopers are briefly shot with lasers. There is also a scene where Chewbacca knocks a few stormtroopers off a ledge. Chewbacca chokes Lando out of anger and frustration. We see the man strangling and trying to breath. He eventually releases the character. Some implied alcohol use in the Cloud City sequences. In the remastered version, there is a potential jump-scare involving the creature. Even the creature's actions can be quite scary as it happens so fast. In another scene, Luke goes into a dark cave where strange animal sounds are heard. He then has a slow motion lightsaber encounter with Darth Vader where he cuts off Vader's head and then sees his own face in the helmet, symbolizing his danger of being corrupted by the dark side of the Force.

After Neo encounters her, one of his shipmates says he can arrange a more personal experience with her, at which point someone jokingly refers to him as a ""digital pimp"". just two kissing scenes Scene takes place in a sex club. There are many people in the background in fetish wear. Some female breast nudity but not in focus. The violence is moderate in impact with mostly bloodless shootouts and stylized martial arts combat that result in little to no blood. An Agent is shot in the head by Trinity. There is no blood/gore An Agent is Shot in the Head. Little blood Lots of killings with machine guns, resulting in numerous bodies and little blood. There are gunshot wounds on the chests and on the backs of a few people. One man gets zapped by a laser gun and we see his charred, bloody arm. There are numerous martial arts fights with lots of punching and hitting. A few more intense scenes have closeups of people being punched with blood around their mouths. Some people get their bodies slammed against walls. Not very brutal. A man has a creature extracted from his navel, no blood is shown. Trinity throws a knife into a man's forehead during an action scene, but we don't see any blood, nor do we clearly see the impact. An agent is shot at an extremely close range; we don't see the impact in detail but there is a brief red mist. A man is shot by a lot of bullets. You briefly see the the impact. Neo shoots a few people at a security gate. When people die in the matrix, their bodies in the real world cough up blood and die as well. A couple of people are killed with a laser gun, we don't see much detail. A woman beats another man up, she face-palms him and kicks him. She dodges bullets discharged by other cops, throws a chair at one of them, shoots another, then chops/kicks the final one to the ground. It is assumed all those cops die. She flees from more cops, jumping off rooftops and crashing through windows, and runs to a pay phone in order to get out of the situation. A garbage truck plows down the phone booth but she lives. There is a closeup of Morpheus being shot in the leg with a tiny bit of blood spray. Not too graphic. A group of police officers viciously beat Morpheus and he is seen covered in dust and has blood on his face. Morpheus and Agent Smith fight briefly. Morpheus gets punched several times. Blood is seen around his mouth. Mescaline is mentioned When tasked with choosing between reality or The Matrix's simulation of reality, Neo is offered two pills by Morpheus. One pill will take Neo back to his normal life in The Matrix, while the other will reveal to Neo the actual reality of The Matrix. Choi smokes a cigarette at the club, Dujour is seen with a drink. Cypher and Neo share a drink that is implied to be alcoholic based on Neo's aversive reaction. Cypher and Agent Smith have wine at dinner. Cypher also smokes a cigar. The Oracle smokes a cigarette. Although the violence is glamourized, it mostly has a very light tone and is not disturbing. Neo tries to escape from the FBI by climbing out of a window and walking on a very narrow ledge. He freaks out when the wind picks up, he goes back inside, and gets arrested. We see the cops put him in a car. Arguably the most disturbing scene in the movie, Neo gets arrested and is taken into an interrogation room where his mouth becomes sealed and then a robotic ""bug"" resembling a shrimp enters his body through his navel, it is disturbing and scary. Later this ""bug"" is extracted by a machine. This scene and where the ""bug"" is put into Neo. A traitor kills two of his crew mates by unplugging their heads from a computer, where their minds are. The crew mates look worried, and then they collapse dead on the ground. No blood whatsoever, but is intense. The songs in the end credits have some uses of the f bomb. All words are used alone or in combination with other words. 18 uses of shit, 6 hell, 5 damn 3 ass 1 dick, shut up, crap."

Karen hides a gun in her panties. There is a five second close up on her hip. Her genitals are not seen. Some sexual references. A man and woman kiss very quickly on a bed. There is no sex or nudity. A man starts kissing a woman. They then start to hug but the scene cuts right there. A man and woman are making out. The man's shirt comes off but nothing after that as it cuts straight away. Karen bends down and puts her head near Henry's crotch implying she is about to perform oral sex. She unzips his pants and the scene cuts. Karen's panties are seen when she is thrown off the bed. It's implied that two people have an affair. We do not see this happen, we only hear that they were having an affair. Several scenes of violence but no gore is shown. However, it can still be graphic and lots of blood is often shown. One character is something of a loose cannon and violence usually occurs around him. A man with blood all over his torso is running and screaming claiming he's been shot. Some blood is shown dripping everywhere but not too graphic. There are several instances where people get roughed up by gangsters. The violence portrayed is quite realistic and portrayed as cold and often gets very brutal. A man is bashed once on the head with a wine bottle. He has a slightly bloody bandage afterwards. A frozen corpse is discovered in the back of a meat truck. No blood. A father hits his son twice and whips his back with a belt 5 times. The boy has a somewhat bruised face after. A man hits another man's face with a gun eleven times. He grunts in pain and blood is seen on his face from a distance. Two gangsters beat another gangster. One clubs him with a pistol on the head/face offscreen and the other stomps on his head, we see fleeting glances of his boot crunching onto his face. The victim is partly unconscious, although the pistol whipping causes brief blood spray. His face is then seen mostly covered in blood and bruises, and part of his suit is bloodied. A man is shot in the foot with blood spurts; he winces briefly and a bloody wound is seen for a second. A man is swiftly killed by six gunshots to the chest with a pistol. Blood appears on his shirt. A man yips as his face is slammed against a car seat five times, and then punched three times. Blood is visible on his eyes, nose, and mouth. His face is then seen badly bruised in black-and-white for a few seconds. Two men then threaten to feed him to lions at a zoo. A man and his wife are shown dead in a car with bloody bullet wounds momentarily. Some blood is splattered across the windows. A man is shot in the head. Tons of blood splatters all over a bed and walls. He is then shot several times more offscreen. Two corpses are found in a garbage truck with bloody bullet holes in their faces. Several of the scenes where drugs are being used take place in a kitchen, filled with equipment used to make drugs. Cocaine is snorted a few times. Mostly implied rather than explicit except for scenes in which we see the character's facial reactions. A major character is addicted to drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and quaaludes, and becomes a drug dealer. A scene happens where a frantic women empties a package of cocaine into a toilet. You see the powder. Cops accept bribes of liquor and cigarettes. Cocaine is shown and is snorted once or twice, it isn't graphic and is looked down upon more than anything else in this film. The drug use is pretty strong Moderate to severe, drugs play a major role in the downfall of some characters and they are heavily frowned upon within the film. There is frequent smoking and drinking. A man beats his son with belt as punishment while the mother tries to stop him. Several fatal shootings, stabbings, and beatings are shown with visible blood. This is quite frightening. The final twenty minutes is particularly intense, taking on a distressing tone that noticeably differs from the rest of the film. The film is violent and deals with serious subjects but it's not in any way frightening and the majority of people who aren't sensitive can handle it. This movie is very violent but not very disturbing or intense at all. There are instances of bloody violence, which can often get graphic. Joe Pesci's character is a raging psychopath, and scenes involving him can be intense as violence is always a possibility. The words ""ass"", ""balls"", ""bastard"", ""bitch"", ""bullshit"", ""cocksucker"", ""crap"", ""damn"", ""dick"", ""dickhead"", ""fag"", ""fuck"", ""goddamn"", ""jerkoff"", ""motherfucker"", ""nigger"", ""piss"", ""prick"", ""shit"", and ""whore"" are used. 300 uses of ""fuck"" and ""motherfucker""."

This isn't violent but can be somewhat shocking. People are seen taking medication for mental disorders. They are never misused throughout the movie. There is alot of smoking during the film. Overall, not that much drug use is in the movie. All drugs presented are legal and are used in a medicinal context There is some drinking during the film and many charaters are seen under the influence of alcohol at some points. Nurse Ratched's emotionless expressions give her a somewhat unsettling presence. While this movie can be very Intense for some viewers, there are still some moments that are intended to be comedic and lighthearted to ease the tension. As a whole, the movie is very depressing and cynical. The orderlies and mental patients would often swear a lot 2 uses of motherfucker. 43 uses of ""fuck"" 1 use of ""cunt"".

None A woman is drugged In many ways this film is considered a horror movie The premise of a killer skinning their victims is, by itself, frightening, although the shock factor is greatly lessened by the fact that they does it on corpses rather than living people, and the skinning is not shown. An intense sequence when a killer uses ruthless means to escape. We see finger nails on the wall Buffalo Bill's pit, that is frightening as well as disturbing. It can be disturbing to hear the violent acts that a character has supposedly inflicted. The film's villain is transgender and has a desire to biologically become female, as they makes suits from female skins. There is a chopped head in a glass jar Hannibal talks about sex in a disturbing way. The movie has an overall frightening atmosphere. 14 uses of ""fuck"", 2 uses of ""piss"" 2 uses of ""bitch"", 2 uses of ""son of a bitch"", 6 uses of ""shit"", 1 use of ""Goddamn"", 2 uses of ""hell"" 4 uses of ""damn"". 2 uses of ""cunt,"" both within 5 minutes of each other."

Some nudity but not graphic at all. A man is described as a ""rapist"" Though this is never seen or talked about again. Two guys walk into a motel and open up each room to see tangled bodies very actively engaging in intercourse. Sensitive parts are most obscured by the entanglement of limbs, but we do see an extended shot of a man's butt as he thrusts on top of a woman. Lots of themes of sexuality, lots of sex talk, and aspirations to lose one's virginity, to rape, and to get laid. Two different scenes where guys are completely naked other than their hands slightly covering their genitals. We see pubic hair and lots of side butt, but they manage to hide the rest. We hear a woman recount an extremely graphic sex act that involves anal and using bananas. We then cut to see a banana and active, writhing nude bodies blurred behind it. A bare chested man gets out of bed. Not graphic. A scene in a hotel where a woman's butt is seen extremely briefly. Blink and you'll miss it. Many storeowners/banks are robbed during the movie. All the victims are threatened to obey commands from the robbers. Fast cuts of chickens being cleaned as part of food preparation. Incisions on and innards of dead birds shown interspersed with footage of living stock. No slaughter (killing) shown Adults and children brandishing firearms almost non-stop. Gangs of children and teens openly carry firearms in the streets. Many shootings, most of them involving minors and young people as victims and/or shooters. They tend to be brief or bloodless, however A young man becomes upset and starts to put his hands on his girlfriend while they argue about their relationship. No striking or shoving, the tension defuses quickly. Armed robbery of a hotel There's scenes of murder in this film. But they aren't extremely graphic and just like a normal action movie. A character is shot multiple times. His bullet-riddled body in a pool of blood is shown for over 10 seconds A young boy is forced to single out and kill another boy, using a gun. A scene of public hazing/abuse of a man under threat of a firearm. See: Sex & Nudity. Major shoot-out in a public street at night, with many automatic weapons fired and several innocent bystander casualties sustained in the surrounding community. Survivors shown sobbing over the fallen. Several dead bodies are visible. Mild to moderately bloody, but with dark camera angles at night and little actual gore shown Some brief, bloodless beatings. A few of which occur offscreen. Lil' Ze constantly sells and snorts cocaine. Numerous characters (Including children) are seen casually smoking joints or asking for them. Cocaine is snorted a few times Characters are sometimes seen handling, discussing, using, packaging or selling either marijuana or cocaine A violent film due to it's setting, characters and whole story. Corpses of many dead bodies are shown in the movie. A little kid is seen shooting and killings some people while he smiles. This scene is disturbing. MA15+ ( Strong Violence, Strong Adult Themes, Coarse Language & Drug Use ) The foot-shooting and shovel-killing scenes could be hard to watch.

Private Ryan tells a story back to when he and his brothers caught their oldest brother trying to have sex with a girl in their barn. A soldier is briefly shown with his intestines hanging out of his stomach. Very graphic and possibly the most brutal scene in the entire film. Many people are blown up. Sometimes there is gore but other times theres none. A Flak gun is used against an American infantry unit, killing them. Just after the camera cuts to a different angle, a tank crew man is shot in the face at point-blank range. Some blood that sprays out from the headshot can be seen. A bomb blows up prematurely in a soldiers hands, killing him instantly. Intense and bloody. Chunks of blood spray and spurt. A nazi is shot through a wall by a machine gun. Blood sprays onto a wall and is seen for the rest of the movie. We hear a thud and see a puddle of blood form on the ground. A soldier is shot in the throat. Blood squirts and dribbles from his mouth. Blood puddles beneath his body. This scene is brutal. A medic tends to a soldier that has a very graphic wound on his shoulder. Blood is shown and he is yelling and wincing. Several nazis are intensely gunned down by a squad of soldiers inside of a kitchen. Blood and smoke are everywhere. One nazi has blood drooling out of his mouth. Several scenes with charred up dead bodies shown throughout the movie. There is a very intense event in which a young soilder without an arm, seems to calmly (due to shock) pick up his recently dismembered arm and walks away. An American sniper shoots a Nazi sniper right through the scope into his eye. The bullet goes through the entire head (we very briefly see his gory eye socket and bits of matter spray) and stains the wall behind the nazi with blood. Graphic. Two soldiers (who are Czech) are clearly attempting to surrender with their hands in the air but are shot by US soldiers and then mocked (""Look, I washed for supper""). A soldier is briefly seen headless. Intense war violence throughout (especially in the first 20 minutes). All of it is realistic, but like a lot of other live-action war movies, it's meant to portray how awful war is. This is definitely the darkest DreamWorks movie, ahead of Artificial Intelligence. That's saying a lot. Strong violence through out the whole movie. In the begging scene where they storm the beach you see dozens of men get brutally killed and shot up Left to right The first 27 minutes of the film depict soldiers landing on Omaha beach in Normandy. This is the most graphic and intense part of the film, and the sequence contains bloody, graphic violence, which can be disturbing. During the sequence many soldiers are shot with bloody results, people have their limbs shot off, people are burned etc. At the end of the landing sequence the beach is littered with corpses, and the ocean is tinted red. Very strong bloody and graphic violence throughout. The film features prolonged extreme war violence with dismemberment, soldiers engulfed in flames and other intense images. The depiction of war violence remains consistent throughout the film, with hand-to-hand combat, sniper fire, and other inherently violent depictions of war fighting. Morphine is used to sedate a wounded soldier. Characters often smoke cigarettes one character chews chewing tobacco Scenes show the use of tobacco products, but no illegal substances. The entire film has extremely intense, graphic, bloody and chaotic battle sequences that are very brutal and violent. A man is seen picking up his own arm and walking off, one of the darkest scenes of the movie. Intense and realistically gory war violence throughout (especially in the first 20 minutes), but like a lot of other live-action war movies from the mid-90's and on (when they perfected gory special effects), it's meant to portray what war is actually like in real life, and to discourage war. It can also be portrayed as educational to the military if a war does start, though. The battle sequences throughout the film are intense both sensually and emotionally. The opening and closing sequences feature realistic war-fighting, loud gunfire, booming explosions, hand-to-hand combat, intense depictions of death and sequences of soldiers succumbing to their wounds. The intense battle sequences make the viewer immersed by means of handheld cameras, and getting close to the action, to a point where there is frequently blood or rain water on the lens of camera. The first war scene is truly very violent. It is about 20 minutes long. You can't get any more realistic than that scene. Lots of people die. Heads get blown off, bodies explode, and people get stabbed. 19 uses of ""fuck"", 15 uses of ""shit"", 1 use of ""cocksucker"", and some uses of ""goddamn"", son of a bitch"", ""prick"", and ""asshole"""

One character refers to a brothel during a conversation with another man. A man on a bike falls on a woman. They don't get hurt. Guns are present in the film. Not used for gunfire. A man puts his hat on and eggs inside the hat cracks on his head. Very comedic. Wine is served with several meals throughout the film, and guests at a party drink champagne. There is no drunkenness or abuse of alcohol in the film. One of the supporting actors smokes at a party. A few of the soldiers may be shown smoking in the background, but none of the main characters use tobacco products. There is no drug use or abuse in this film. The first half of the film is completely free from frightening/intense scenes. Due to the main character's determination to make his son believe that they are simply playing a ""game,"" and are, in fact, there willingly, many scenes that might otherwise be frightening/intense are made humorous, poignant, and/or bittersweet. Toward the end of the film, the main character tries to free his wife and sneaks through the camp in order to do so. Fairly light, some uses of damn and one use of jackass"

One man grabs a tire iron in preparation of fighting another man, but the conflict never occurs. Two men drink out of beer bottles. Alcohol is briefly sipped at a meeting. Extremely intense and emotional film, dealing with the extinction of mankind itself. It depicts a future Earth that suffers huge dust storms and is running out of food. It is implied billions have died. An action scene involving astronauts attempting to evade a giant tidal wave is intense.

A prisoner named Bill makes sexual comments or references. Prison guards asking a man to get dressed but he doesn't react so they start to dress him and his bare buttocks is shown. A man grabs another man's penis, but it isn't done sexually. No nudity. In the botched execution scene violence is actually quite tame, however it is still very disturbing. In this scene there is no visible blood. Quite a few executions by electric chair. One is botched. An inmate attempts to kill a prison guard by strangulation. He kicks other guards in the process. One guard intervenes before the inmate kills anyone. A man cradles the bodies of two dead girls, their hair matted with blood. Their father bloodlessly punches him across the face a few times before he is pulled away. An antagonist is shot five times in the chest, some blood and bullet wounds appear on his shirt as he slumps down dead. A prisoner elbows one guard and chokes another with handcuffs (a bit of blood spurts from his mouth) before bashing his head on the wall, a bit of blood is on their faces. He then kicks an incoming guard in the crotch before another one hits the prisoner twice, knocking him out. A mouse is purposely smashed by a shoe, we see some blood around its head/face. We see a bit of blood on a door and a small blood trail on a floor. An antagonist hits a prisoner once on the fingers with a billy club, it's later brought up that three of them were broken as a result. A few punches and a slap or two from angry guards towards an antagonist. The guards are shown drinking at one point in the film. One or two brief instances of smoking. Paul and Hal have what may be beer while grilling some food. The guards grind up some sort of medication/pills that they put in Wild Bill's beverage to knock him out. The first execution, while not as violently prolonged as the second, could be hard to watch due to its realism. An antagonist attacks some guards early on. In two scenes, a protagonist is shown to be in pain while urinating. The kidnap, rape, and murder of two little girls play a role in the plot. The rapes and murders are not shown. The kidnapping, which is accomplished via manipulation rather than brute force, is shown. Twelve uses of ""fuck."" ""Fuck"", ""asshole"", ""dick"", and ""shit"" are used throughout the movie.

There is no blood or injury detail, since his body vanishes instantly, leaving only his cloak and weapon behind. (At around 2 min) Darth Vader lifts a man off the floor by the man's throat, interrogating him, and subsequently strangles him to death before throwing him to the floor. The sound of bones being crushed can be heard as the man is strangled. No blood or disfigurement is shown. (At around 38 min) Darth Vader is shown to telekinetically strangle a man half to death. We see and hear the victim moan and writhe, struggling to breathe until Vader releases him. (at around 40 min) The burned and smoking skeletons of Owen and Beru Lars lying on the ground near the entryway to a small burning structure are visible by there stunned and horrified nephew, Luke Skywalker, after he has rushed home to their see about their well-being. They are not focused on and are quite easy to miss. (At around 45 min) Obi-Wan Kenobi cuts off the arm of an attacker with his lightsaber who was threatening him with a gun. In this scene, the severed arm is shown lying on the ground with some blood around and in it. (at around 50 min) Han Solo is intercepted by Greedo pointing a laser gun at him, in an establishment. While conversing, they sit opposite of each other at a table there, and several times Greedo expresses intention to shoot Han dead. Throughout this time, Han has covertly drawn his own laser gun and, from his waist, obscuredly aimed it at Greedo. This is suspenseful. In the original version of the film, just as Greedo about make good on his aggressive words, space above the table explodes into a momentary cloud of smoke, and the alien's dead body is shown slumping forward onto the table, as he had been shot by Han. Whereas in Special and subsequent editions of the film, Greedo is shown to fire at but miss Han's head before being immediately shot dead by Han's return fire. There are numerous scenes of gunplay, all of which leave no visible wounds. (at around 1 h 54 min) A massive space station ignites into an enormous shock wave and explosion that kills all lifeforms on board. There is a scene early on in the film set at a bar. Numerous characters are drinking unidentified beverages, presumed to be alcoholic. One character in the scene is seen smoking a hookah, and another appears to be smoking a cigarette on a holder. (At around 50 min) Han Solo's fight scene in the bar leaves a smoking husk of alien on a table.

A guard licks Sarah's face when he thinks she's asleep A tavern waitress is aroused by a nude T-800; her sexually suggestive reaction is only visible through the Terminator's point of view. No explicit nudity shown. Sara's nipples can be seen through her white shirt during the prison scene. The T-1000 turns his finger into a needle and stabs a police officer through his eye. Little blood is shown. Near the beginning of the film, two orderlies tase Sarah for several seconds with a stun gun and force pills down her throat. Not lengthy or graphic but can be disturbing for some. The Terminator throws a biker into a bar's kitchen. The biker lands on a large grill and is briefly burned before falling off. During the future war scene, many soldiers are shot by lasers on machines. (Not graphic.) A man puts out his cigar on the Terminator's shoulder. The Terminator then crushes the man's hand in its grip. The T-1000 kills a police officer and takes his clothes and his squad car. The Terminator and T-1000 shoot at each other in a hallway. An innocent bystander is gunned down in the crossfire. They then struggle and crash through a wall, and one is thrown through a window. The T-1000 (disguised as John's foster mother) transforms his arm into a sword-like weapon and impales John's foster father through his head while drinking from a milk carton. ""She"" then pulls it out and the man's corpse falls to the ground. Some blood, mixed with milk. The T-1000 kills a dog and rips off it's collar, blood is seen on the collar (uncut version only). An orderly at a mental institute is hit across the face by a broom handle. Blood spurts. Sarah sneaks up on a man and a guard and repeatedly whacks the guard with a baton before breaking the man's arm with it and hitting him on the back of the knees, so he falls. Sarah Connor puts a syringe on Silberman's neck that is filled with poison. She does not empty the poison into him though. T-101 shoots an officer twice in his legs. Impact shots are seen and he screams in pain. When a group of male nurses hold Sarah down and attempt to inject her, the Terminator grabs one man and throws him into a window, smashing it. He then picks up another and throws him through a glass door. A third man runs at him with his baton and tries to hit him but the Terminator hits him in the stomach with his rifle and throws him away, he hits a wall very hard and bounces off. Sarah dreams about a nuclear attack and a large nuclear weapon detonates over a city. We see many children and their mothers burning and screaming. Sarah then catches on fire and screams horribly. Later, when the blast comes, the carbonized bodies of the women and children disintegrate and Sarah screams as her flesh is ripped off. The Terminator cuts the skin off his arm and rips it away to reveal his metal skeleton. Graphic. At Cyberdyne, Dyson is shot several times with blood spurts. People are seen drinking alcohol in a bar. Sarah is physically forced by male nurses to take her medication that she refuses. A man in a bar is smoking a cigar. Sarah Connor is shown smoking a cigarette in a couple scenes. The T-1000 morphs out of the floors, and stabs a jovial security guard through the eye. The security guard shakes in tremulous pain, and dies as the T-1000 observes his movements in interest. M12+ ( Frequent Violence & Coarse Language ) Some intense (and often one-sided) fights. Two guards force Sarah in a mental institute to take her meds by beating and shocking her. (uncut version only) A dog is killed, which may upset some animal lovers (uncut version only).

As two characters fly fast and low to the ground, some women's robes are blown up as they make surprised noises. Nothing is shown. A giant baby wears an open-back outfit. Brief cleavage is present in the film. Haku (dragon form) is chased by paper birds who cut him. His blood splatters everywhere in the room (over the walls, etc). His mouth also bleeds. The scene is quite long. The sound of blood being spat out is heard. Kamaji tells Sen that Haku is bleeding internally and she has to stick her arm in his mouth to give him medicine. He has sharp teeth and she nearly gets bitten by him. No-Face at one point goes on a rampage and eats people, but they are later spat out and revealed to be unharmed. He also vomits violently at different points, and is greedy and gluttonous. A monster is made of many dirty substances. When Sen/Chihiro rips a fishing rod's lure & hook out of the monster, blood and mucus pour out of the hole. Yubaba tells Haku ""I get to give Sen one final test, if she fails, she's mine"" (meaning she'll kill her). One character smokes a cigarette; a character has an ash tray with cigarettes in it. A character is seen opening a window and smoking a cigarette. One character tells a customer that he can buy sake. After bathing the polluted river spirit, Yubaba sees the money Sen has made and triumphantly shouts, ""Sake's on the house tonight!"" Sen gives Haku a drug-like ball of what appears to be dirt or mud. The film is mostly comforting and heart-warming whilst it is bizarre and unsettling. Some spirits are quite strange looking. Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs. The scene in which Haku is attacked by paper birds can be rather intense. The overall theme is very dark, involving a young girl who is alone, facing the loss of both parents, and is in near constant peril. Also the main character is a child (10-years old) is being imprisoned for most of the movie in a strange ghost world. This is a very scary thought. Yubaba threatens to rip Sen's mouth off. A man dances around singing, ""welcome the rich man, he's hard for you to miss, his butt keeps getting bigger so there's plenty there to kiss!"" Many characters frequently make fun of Chihiro/Sen for being a human, telling her that she smells bad and that she's lazy and stupid. Lin frequently calls her ""dope"" which starts out as being rude, but then it just becomes a teasing nickname and they become close friends."

The famous ""shower scene"" shows no nudity and nothing inappropriate Two people are seen getting dressed, it is implied that they had sex. Nothing graphic in the slightest. A man watches a woman undress. Nothing is shown except for her in a bra In Norman's parlor, there is some paintings of nude people. Very hard to see nipples. Marion is seen in her bra at least twice for an extended period of time. Lots of cleavage. No nudity. There is no explicit nudity in this movie, whereas there are a few mild ones. We see a woman in bra for an extended period of time, and we also see a lot of kisses in the movie. The shower scene also contains nudity, whereas its blurred and nothing explicit is shown, although you see the overall shape of the persons body easily. A man and woman kiss at the beginning for a bit nothing extreme. No sex is shown. Body count: 2 A man is stabbed while he is running up the stairs, the wound is not seen. This is inaccurate, unless it refers to an edited version shown on TV. He is actually walking slowly up the stairs, and a bloody slash wound is clearly visible on his face as he falls backwards down the stairs although this is not graphic. Besides a scene in which a man smokes, the drug and alcohol content of this movie is nonexistent. There is however an early scene in which drinking/alcoholism are subtly joked about between two men. Bernard Herrmann's score can be scary and suspenseful. The stabbing violins in the iconic shower scene are startling and intense. Rated R for violence, terror, and mild sensuality This film contains substantial suspense that at times transcends the plot. Although the story is engrossing, a good portion of the atmosphere arises from scenery and music, which alone may frighten younger viewers. This does not take into consideration the film's depictions of violence, that aren't graphic. The most blatant instance of violence occurs relatively early on and serves to heighten the suspense of the rest of the film. Many scenes in the movie are frightening. Mild"

Man in bath tub is shown; nudity is limited to his bare chest. A young boy tries to crawl under a stone wall, he gets half way through, is grabbed from the other side and is beaten to death (we see him struggling and hear him crying out and then he goes limp). A man in a wheelchair is shoved off a balcony and we watch him crash onto the street below. A woman is shot in the head, men are forced to lie face down on the street and are shot one-by-one in the head (blood pours from the wounds). People run into the streets and are gunned down, we see them fall, see blood on their clothing and watch as a truck drives over their bodies (one man was still alive before he was run over). A man and a woman run through a street, the woman is shot and she falls to her knees. We see many dead bodies littering a desolate, rubble covered street (women and children with pools of blood around their heads), we see a few dead bodies lying near a train track, and we see dead bodies slumped against a blood splattered wall. A man is whipped on the back until he falls unconscious and dragged through the mud, and a line of men is whipped by a drunken officer. A soldier is shot as he and others march through a street; guns are fired from the street into a building and the people inside shoot back, fires break out inside the building and we see people jumping out of windows in flames and hear them hit the ground; others are brought out of the building, lined up and shot. Soldiers are shot by civilians, grenades are thrown into a building, and we see puddles of blood on the ground and the building burns. A tank takes aim and fires on a building where a man is hiding, he runs to the roof, he is shot at by men in a building in the distance, and as the man runs through the building again he passes a dead man in a stairwell who is burned and tattered. We see people being shot in a street and dead bodies strewn around, and a man who's pursued lies among them pretending to be dead, as soldiers march by. A flame thrower is used in a building where a man is hiding: he runs, jumps from a low window, hurts his leg, limps away and hides in an attic in a building. A man is shot at by soldiers and they hold him at gunpoint. A pile of dead bodies is set on fire (we see them engulfed in flames and then charred and smoldering). A young boy cries over his father's dead body, and we see a dead body on the street with an exposed bloody leg bone. People walk past a dead body on the street and two men push a cart full of dead bodies. A man is beaten with a stick, a man is beaten with a gun butt, a man is punched in the nose and he bleeds, and a man is punched in the face (he falls to the ground, gets up and is forced to walk in the gutter rather than on the sidewalk). We hear a gunshot and a woman screams. Soldiers barge into a building, punch a man, go into an apartment, we hear yelling and watch as a man is surrounded by the soldiers. Lines of wounded people walk through a street, followed by soldiers with guns. We see horse carcasses in a street after a bombing. People are collected, packed onto train cars, the doors are closed and locked and we hear them screaming. Soldiers are collected and locked in a pen and are berated by other men walking by. A man appears very ill and we hear that he has had no nourishment for some time. Soldiers march through rubble strewn streets in a few scenes, while civilians watch in fear. Bombs drop and explode outside a building, windows break, a roof falls in while people inside the building run and dodge the debris, and one man is hit in the head and we see some blood. We hear that people are being hunted down in the streets. As a train full of people pulls away, a man says, ""...off they go to the melting pot,"" a man talks about people being hanged for helping Jews, and two men talk about extermination. People smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Many deaths are seen, including children. The movie is very realistic with this showing blood around children's bodies and wounds. Much of the first part of the film is focused on the brutal living conditions faced by the Jewish people in Poland during WWII. There are many disturbing, violent scenes throughout, but the majority are in the first half or so. Scenes involving a child being beaten to death and an entire family executed in the street are especially intense. We watch the degradation of people who are forced to wear arm bands so as to be ethnically labeled, they are forced to leave their homes and belongings, families are separated and we hear that if they do not do as they are ordered they will be severely punished. There are several battle scenes and frequent explosions, and an intense scene involving flamethrowers. The overall tone of the film is dark and the violence is realistic and hard-hitting. Starvation is depicted throughout. Since the film takes place in the holocaust it is a very hard and sad film to see. A woman goes mad after having smothered her child while trying to keep it from crying (she moans/cries in regret and repeats ""why did I do it"" aloud to herself). The smothering is not shown, the story of it happening is told from a third party while she cries in the background. A woman begs for water for her unconscious child. An elderly man is forced to dance to keep warm, then others gathered around him are forced to dance with him, and one man with a cane falls to the ground. There is more than one use of fuck and they are all said by the Russians. 5 scatological terms, 3 mild obscenities, 4 religious exclamations."

A man grabs a woman's butt briefly. A man and woman lying together on a couch begin touching each other. No nudity is seen, the scene is tame, only lasting a minute or two. There is some talk about sex in a couple scenes but nothing too explicit Ki-Woo and Da-Hye kiss in a couple scenes. One very passionate kissing scene. No nudity Mild to Moderate - No nudity or sex scenes in the entire film. However, some heavy kissing, sexual references and sexual play are shown in the film, awkward and not graphic. The movie is violent towards the end. Gore wise there are a few scenes with some blood, but nothing very graphic. The violence is almost all in the last third of the film. Three characters are killed by stabbing. Blood is shown. During a flood, a young woman smokes a cigarette while sitting on an overflowing toilet. Characters are shown drunk. While role playing, a woman asks her husband to buy her drugs. This is talk about firing someone from their job as it is theorized that the worker was using drugs in their bosses car. The scene is comedic. There is use of cigarets, drug references and alcohol use, but drugs are not a theme at all. Although it has humor in it, Parasite has a dark tone and some frightening moments. The ""ghost"" scene contains briefly frightening imagery. The film is generally based on the differences of poor to wealthy groups of people. A few scenes in the film are extremely intense and frightening. The final confrontation is extremely tense and scary. There is some unexpected violence that may frighten viewers, it's not intense and is only towards the end. There is mild profanity throughout, however ""Fuck"" is said a couple dozen times in the subbed version. Fuck is shown on the subtitles for non Korean speakers, other than that the profanity is very mild."

A man squeezes his wife's breast and they start kissing. Their daughter walks in on them before anything remotely explicit or inappropriate is shown. A 12 year old girl is attracted to an older man and she will constantly refer to this jokingly. Nothing inappropriate is ever done and nothing happens between them. A naked woman Is killed (she Is covered by the water) but when she Is shot to death full side nudity Is seen. Implied sex with a prostitute, nothing heard, woman is seen with sheet over body after. The violence is pretty graphic, but the film focuses more on the drama than the action. So, it's pretty infrequent. A man pulls someone off of a balcony and you hear him scream as he falls to his death. A man shoots someone. While you do not see the bullet hit, you do see some blood on a nearby wall. A man shoots a girl with a shotgun (not graphic) but you do see a bloody wound for a second. A small boy is shot dead. This is not shown, however it is discussed heavily throughout the film and you see the killer trying to shoot the boy. This scene is extremely intense. A man walks into a room and shoots two people with considerable blood spray. Stansfield takes some kind of psychoactive pill twice during the film; he also lights up a cigarette in one scene. Tony is shown drinking several times at his bar. A 12-year-old girl smokes and drinks throughout the film. The main antagonist is a psychopathic and violent dirty cop. He may be disturbing to some. Rated R: Strong bloody graphic violence, some drug content and for language. Themes of dirty cops and a small girl training to be an assassin may upset some people. There is a rather long scene where an entire family with young children is executed one by one. There is also an undercurrent of sexual tension between a pre-adolescent girl and a much older man. This is dealt with in more verbal detail (Leon refused Mathilda's advances and they discuss the appropriateness of their relationship) in the extended ""Version Longue"". ""Fuck"" is said 15-20 times ""Christ"" and ""Jesus"" are abused. 1-G*d da*n"

As cubs this can be taken as innocent playtime, but when they are adults there may be sexual connotations, especially given the way they gaze at each other. Scar throws fiery embers at Simba's face. Rafiki fights off the hyenas in the final battle, however this was done more for comedic effect. Hyenas crawl out from their dark, steaming boneyard to threaten young Simba, Nala, and Zazu. They stick Zazu in a lava pit in an effort to cook him (he rockets off with a smoking trail) and then lunge with snapping jaws at the scurrying cubs. Simba scratches a hyena's face in defense of Nala. Just before disaster strikes, Mufasa charges in and bats the hyenas violently about.  Simba is thrown off the edge of a cliff, but grabs onto the edge, and is dangling over a forest fire, but doesn't fall. Pumba almost says 'farted', but Timon stops him saying 'Not in front of the kids!' Scar insults the hyenas.

Near the end of the movie, Commodus bend down to his sister lying down the bed. Inches close of an incestuous kiss, he blackouts. Male characters are frequently shown shirtless or bare-chested throughout the film. During an arena battle, a female archer can be seen wearing form-fitted armor complete with nipples. It is not explicit, and can only be seen in a few quick shots. No nudity in the movie. Only some references A man treats a graphic wound on his body, which we see up close and for several seconds. Although most of the violence in this movie is quite brief, it is still pretty graphic and highly realistic. There is a lot of violence in this movie, quite often including a flash of blood, however most of it is very brief The first arena battle includes a spiked ball on a chain getting smashed into someone's face. It is very brief, but there is a large blood spurt. This is by far the most violent scene in the movie. Multiple scenes showing bloody violence, much of it in brief shots. There is a rather bloody battle near the beginning (as well as a couple other shorter ones), and a few bloody arena battles. Men are killed with blows and dull objects, and stabbed with swords, knives, and spears (often with brief blood). There are a few brief instances of dismemberment and couple of decapitation, we usually see a flash of red. An opponent is also cut in half by blades on a chariot's wheel during combat; violent, but brief. An attacking tiger is stabbed with a sword, no blood is shown. A man slices off a tattoo on his upper arm, with a bit of bleeding. There are a few scenes with the infrequent drinking of beverages that may or may not be alcoholic in nature. Some pretty intense fights (gladiatorial or otherwise), and a violent escape. Two uses of whore 1 use of shithole A few insults, and one use of 'shit'.

You see thrusting and bare breasts briefly. The only nudity in this movie are some male buttocks in the shower and bare breasts briefly in the sex scene The main character gets raped in prison while taking a shower. Brief male genitalia and buttocks are shown in the shower scenes, which take place in a prison. Very brief, non-sexual. The violence is in no way glorified. A man gets elbowed in the face during a basketball game. Blood is seen on the ground. Later he spits out a lot of blood. Two brothers briefly get into a little scuffle. Violence in this movie isn't too frequent. The curb bite scene is the most brutal scene but we dont see anything. A gang of white supremacists rob and terrorize a grocery store that employs minorities, hitting and kicking various individuals multiple times onscreen. A group of black teens kick a caucasian teen twice in the chest before they are stopped. A bit of blood is seen on the victim's mouth. Derek punches and kicks an old man in the face once for trying to corrupt his brother Danny. Blood runs down his nose. Derek angrily shoves a mouthful of food in his sister's mouth to keep her from talking. This briefly causes her to choke. She then wields a baseball bat. A mother becomes addicted to smoking to cope with her son going to prison. Danny, Dereck's teenage brother, is shown smoking very often. People are seen smoking (including teenagers). There is a party scene with beer and some drunkenness among people Marijuana (trafficking) is briefly discussed in a prison The main character's acts of domestic violence during a dinner scene are emotionally disturbing and upsetting. This movie can be very disturbing and violent at times, but it is not scary. The main plot in this movie is about racism, and it could be disturbing for some viewers. This movie in general is intense and emotional, especially the ending. No racial group is left out of the hate exercised in this movie. 214 uses of ""fuck"", 30 uses of ""shit"", 38 uses of ""nigger"", 5 uses of ""bitch"", 4 uses of ""asshole"" and ""spic"", 3 uses of ""kike"" and ""monkey"", 3 uses of ""cracker"", 1 use of ""spooks"", ""Son of a Bitch"", ""pecker wood"", ""beaner"", ""ass"", and ""niglet"".

In a few scenes it is implied that they will have sex. Early in the film Frank Costello calls a girl, presumably 16-18, behind the counter and asks her if she wants to have sex with him (the girl before on the counter is seen to be making eye contact with Frank) this is played as a joke. Costello is heard masturbating in a theater. He then stands up and turns around to face another character, a penis is briefly shown on screen, though it is obviously fake. Then Costello later talks about ""not understanding how people masturbate in a theater."" The act isn't shown and the scene is meant to be funny. A man and a woman passionately kiss on a bed for around 20 seconds. He is clothed, she is wearing an unbuttoned shirt with a see through bra. She is in her underwear. Many vulgar sexual references throughout Most of the movies sexual content are crude sexual references and brief nudity in the cinema scene. There's a flashback of people beating each other up over who rides the bus. A man and a woman are shot in the head with blood mist. This is shown from the side so it's not as graphic. A man fidgets with a severed hand, the bag it was in is also covered in blood A man beats someone to death somewhat offscreen with a metal pipe, blood sprays onto walls. Brief and offscreen A man throws a toy at at a mans face, a cut forms on his face. A man is shot in the head with blood spray, we see his dead body on the ground with a bloody bullet hole in his head. A shootout begins between Costello's gang and some police men afterwards, a man gets shot in the stomach, large amount of blood sprays from the wound. A police officer is shot in the shoulder, blood spray, he falls to the ground, a puddle forms beneath him. Costello is seen with blood all over his clothes and arms from doing who knows what. Onscreen body count: 24. There are multiple shootings that are bloody and abrupt. Characters die unexpectedly There are some black and white pictures of dead men who executed by gangsters and mobsters. There is some blood seen on their bodies. A brief flashback of a man killing his wife. Multiple scenes of bloody violence but nothing overly graphic or gory. When Mr French and Frank search Billy they take his broken hand and bang it on the table, frank then asks him if he's a cop twice while he's hitting his arm with his boot. This can be very intense and disturbing for some viewers A man shoots himself and his car explodes A man is bashed over the head with a glass leaving a bloody wound on his head. He is later punched around the face a few times, knocking him out. A man beats up two mobsters in a store, as he punches one of them in the face repeatedly, he breaks his hand, we hear it crack, the other mobsters face is bashed with a coat hanger. Their bodies are later found in a ditch implying that they were killed. They have very bloody faces, they are seen for a few seconds. A man is roughing up another man around the face before a man is punched once, with two teeth knocked out. A man is stabbed once in the chest with a pocket knife and dies from this A man falls from a building. The impact is not seen, but some blood sprays onto a man. His body is then briefly shown with blood on his face, and a blood puddle beneath his head and his whole body A man punches another man in the face four times, leaving him with blood pouring from his nose. Two men get shot in the head with blood mist. A man throws a painting on a man's forehead, we see a big cut that's bleeding on his forehead, he then gets shot in the kneecap with blood showing, he starts to scream in pain. A group of policemen break into a crack house. Men are seen packaging bags of cocaine in a dope house. A needle and a spoon are seen on a table, implying that a man has done heroin. He then keeps on making claims that he is high. Billy is shown taking OxyContin in a few scenes. There is drug references but only a little bit of brief scenes of drug usage One of the main topics of this film is drugs (the antagonist is a drug dealer) A man tests a bag of cocaine by tasting it. A man throws cocaine on a bed and tells a woman not to get up until she is numb. A large amount of cocaine is shown in bags at one point. People are shown drinking alcohol and smoking in a number of scenes. The store beating scene is intense. Not a very scary movie but pretty intense and suspenseful. Not scary or frightening, just very intense and thrilling Very intense and heart-racing moments throughout. Costello's interrogation of Billy will make audiences cringe. Some of the violence occurs very suddenly in moments you least expect it. Constant graphic language. 237 uses of ""fuck"", 5 uses of ""cunt"" and ""cocksucker"", 24 uses of ""shit"", 10 uses of ""ass"", and 1 use each of ""faggot"" and ""son of a bitch"". 4 uses of ""damn"" (2 paired with ""God""), 2 uses of ""nigger"". References to Italians in a manner some may find offensive. Chinese and Irish slurs are also heard. Some of the language is used sexually but most of the sexual references comes from Costello"

There's a blurry and stylized flashback of a rape. It happens quick and blurred so mostly of it is offscreen. A nude statue is shown from the waist up. If you blink, you'll miss it. A man talks about finding a fully nude woman in his car. A man is shot in the head. Little blood is shown. Two men are killed in an elevator leaving bloody smears and a little bit of brain matter. A charred decomposed corpse is shown. It is almost burnt until a skeleton, very hard to watch. There's a stylized and blurry flashback of a home assault. The mother is raped (part of it offscreen) and her children are threatened in front of their father. For his reputation, the father kills his family and two of the thieves. No blood is shown. A man is shot in the back. Blood splatters in front of him. Many scenes of men with guns and many men are shot and killed (with some blood). There is a shootout on a boat. A child's throat is slit in a stylised flashback. Even though there is no blood it is still quite disturbing. A man is burned in boat explosion and shown covered in bandages. The actual wound isn't shown A man shoots another man in the back with a rifle. No blood. A man shoots two men. Wounds appear and blood slowly trickles from each. They fall leaving small red stains on a car parked behind them A boat is blown up in several scenes. There are many discussions of illegal drug dealings. Some characters are shown smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages. The central event of the film is the assault on a ship rumored to be carrying 91 million dollars of cocaine The flashback to an assault on a woman and several children is quite disturbing. The many deaths throughout may be difficult for some viewers. The main characters are criminals, and they commit several crimes throughout the film. Though not frightening, viewers may find the last 10 minutes of the film amazingly intense, seeing as it spits out two twists, one right after the other. ""Cocksucker"" is used at least 8 times Non-stop language. The slur ""f*g"" is used 100 uses of ""fuck"". Along with other uses of profanity such as ""shit"", ""bitch"", ""asshole"", and ""dick""."

Since they're mostly clothed, there is no nudity, though, sex is mildly implied (the camera cuts almost instantly, so nothing is shown). The same married man also cheats on his wife and is seen with another woman in bed. Some of the female performers wear revealing outfits (i.e. cleavage, some leg, etc.). This is never focused upon and is merely a form of abstract attire that they wear for their performances. The tone of this movie is serious, not comedic. Two characters are dueling throughout the movie, sabotaging each other, often ending in serious injury. Some blood can be seen at times, but violent scenes are generally not gory or explicit (the movie is PG-13). See details below. A man shoots a man in the chest, the man gasps and slumps to the ground dead. We see some blood on his shirt. A woman is shown hanged. A man has a noose placed around his neck, a hatch opens beneath his feet, and we hear a crack. A bird gets crushed (quietly). We see its bloody and mutilated body later. At another point, a bird is smashed again. The camera cuts away just in time, but we see a blood splatter. A man shoots another man's hand, taking off two fingers (we briefly see the bloody digits). A man falls through stairs and into a box where he is trapped, the box is nailed shut and then buried underground (the man in the box shoots through it and strikes a man on the outside in the arm). However the man is soon dug up and rescued. A man is held by police with a nightstick across his throat, and he thrashes and struggles to get away. A man shoots another man in the chest. (This is a different scene than the one previously mentioned). There is a small and very brief spurt of blood. This is extremely hard to catch and the camera cuts as soon as it happens. Men are shown drinking alcohol in a pub. People drink alcohol in several scenes, and people drink champagne in a celebratory scene. Two magicians stick messages to each other onto the bottom of glasses of beer. One man is described as being perpetually drunk and is shown comically stumbling around and slurring his words. A man notices that something is upsetting his wife when she starts drinking more often at home. A dead body (the man that fell into the water tank) is shown for confirmation in a autopsy room. A man falls into a water tank that locks (he struggles to get out but cannot) and a man tries to break the glass but cannot before the man drowns (we see the dead man on an autopsy table, his eyes are open and his body is pale). We see bits of this scene multiple times. This movie is very intense, serious and grim. ""Sh*t"" is said once. ""B*stard"" is used a few times."

There are minor sexual references made throughout by Fletcher, but overall no nudity. Nothing graphic A man plays the drums quickly and gets an open callus. Instead of stopping, he puts on a bandage and keeps playing. Blood seeps through the bandage, and the man puts on more bandages. Fletcher throws objects, including a chair and a cymbal, and slaps Andrew in the practice sessions. Fletcher is verbally abusive to his students. Drumming involving bloodied hands. Drops of blood can also be clearly seen on drum sets. In one scene, Andrew dips his injured hand in a bucket of ice water and it becomes quite bloody. A man is shown drinking alcohol in a jazz bar. Some mild drinking involved. Some of the scenes in the film can be very intense and unexpected for sensitive viewers. Terence Fletchers meltdowns and abusive techniques are horrible and can be very hard to watch for all viewers. Although a music-themed film, the film is extremely intense throughout as well as emotional. In particular, Fletcher's treatment of his students is incredibly disturbing, to the point of outright cruelty, and will upset most viewers. Some religious profanities: ""goddamn"" and ""Jesus Christ"". Much of the language is used by Fletcher, though Andrew uses some, too. Many uses of ""fuck"". Constant uses of ""shit"", ""damn"" (along with adding God), and ""God"" or ""Jesus"". 1/2 uses of cunt. 97 uses of ""Fuck"".

A few kissing scenes. A married woman indirectly mentions that she has to sleep with a man for an exit visa. It is heavily implied that Ugarte has become the victim of an extralegal German execution after his arrest. Three men are shot onscreen in the film -- the two German couriers at the opening of the film, and a German officer at the movie's climax. In none of these instances is there any blood or gore. Drugs: None The majority of the film is set in Rick's bar, and there are numerous sequences where characters are drinking and smoking. Ilsa Lund pulls a gun on Rick just prior to the climax of the film in an attempt to bluff him into giving her the letters of transit. Near the end of the movie, we see that a major figure in the film is about to stop two main characters from boarding a plane. Movie has a very intense mood.

In the extended edition at the end Salvatore meets Elena in a car and they kiss. Sex is implied but not shown. Later she tells him that she did it with him because in their youth they never have sex before. A woman is shown breastfeeding her baby in the cinema. A row of boys appear to be masturbating in the theater to an erotic film, and are shown from the waist up. (We see a completely nude woman lying face down for a few seconds... no graphic nudity.) A man in a theater is seen spooning a woman standing up and fondling her covered breast, and from his thrusting motions it seems a little more is going on. There are many scenes of passionate kissing from old films, and a few VERY short (less than 1 second) topless scenes. Bare breasts are shown. In the extended edition, we see teenage Salvatore encounter a man having sex with a prostitute. Thrusting is shown and heard and the man is wearing underwear. We soon hear him yell in orgasm. No nudity. Also in the extended edition, we see teenage Salvatore having sex with a prostitute. His pants are shown down sideways, and his face grimaces at a clear orgasm. No nudity. There is a fire that leaves a man injured. You can later see some pretty intense blisters, and he is shown to be blinded by it, with one scene where his empty eye sockets are visible. There is brief, very mild fighting by younger boys. There is a scene where a boy meets his girlfriend's dad, and is later shown with a bandage on his head. A boy is lightly beaten by his teacher, and another boy is hit some by his mother. There are a few violent scenes from movies, but they are old and very tame by modern standards. One of these scenes includes a gangster shootout, and another shows a man hitting a girl around. Some drinking and smoking. A character is shown drunk. Drugs, recreational: None There is some smoking, including some by young boys. A man orders a drink from a bar, and is shown taking a small drink from it before his drops the glass. Various emotional scenes throughout the film The fire scene can be upsetting and intense. Some profanities are used but the language is not very strong. An older man stares at a younger man's girlfriend, and he asks, ""What the fuck are you looking at?"". But this is seen only in the directors cut, in the theatrical version it is omitted."

During a fight scene there are posters of women with exposed breasts and pubic hair visible in the background. These are not the focus of the scene, but readily visible. Towards the end of the movie, Ripley is seen in a short tank top and panties. Her nipples poke through her top. She is in her underwear for at least 10 minutes, it's not sexual. Apart from the chest burst scene the violence and gore is of a moderate level. Overall this movie is probably on par with Jaws. Blood starts to pour and ""rain"" down on two characters, right after another character is killed offscreen The alien shoots its teeth into a man's head. (quickly, before the camera cuts away). Minor gore. In the directors cut an alien bits into a man's head. A character is killed offscreen, but their scream is heard. A man cuts a ""finger"" of a facehugger and it bleeds acid. A woman is punched, which causes her nose to bleed. The crew members smoke cigarettes and drink canned beer. The chestburster scene might be the most terrifying part of the franchise. The main characters are in mortal danger for a large portion of the film. The self-destruct sequence is quite intense. A few jump scares. The Alien itself is one of the most scary looking monster designs in movie history. The head is very obscure with no relations to any kind of humanoid attributes, which makes it very realistic. The body however is more humanoid, and at some points looks very obvious that it's a person in a costume. 4-5 uses of the F-word, as well as some milder profanity like shit and a few uses of bitch. 'F*ck' is said five times. 'Godd*mn' is said. 'H*ll' is said at least three times. 'B*stard' is said. 'H*ll' is said at least four times. 'Sh*t' is said a few times.

Nothing sexual at all. None. Like most Chaplin films, all violence is mild and purely comic. There are boxing scenes, and Chaplin is almost shot because he tries to escape from a house when being framed for robbery. The tramp and his millionaire friend smoke cigars in one scene; his friend is drunk most of the time, and excessive alcohol is featured in several scenes for comic effect. In one scene, the Tramp stumbles upon the rich millionaire while he is contemplating suicide by drowning. High jinks ensue afterward with the Tramp falling in the water, and the rich man falling into the water to save him. None.

A very quick glimpse of his penis can be seen before he sits down and the camera moves. A nude body is seen hanging from a tree. Male genitals are clearly seen and visible for a couple seconds. Three instances of brief male nudity, as entertainment for the troops Three Playboy Bunnies dances suggestively on a stage, they have tight fit clothing exposing cleavage, no nudity is shown and it's not too graphic. We see the dancers later in the movie being stripped by Soldiers in the Helicopter, breast are shown and sex is implied, it is pretty graphic. This scene is around 10 mins long. Male nudity (never explicit or provocative), a brief instance of female breast nudity, posters of woman posing in provocative ways, sometimes with breasts exposed (very brief), and a scene of women dancing sexual as entertainment for the troops, no nudity and not very graphic. A soldier on a boat is bottomless and we see his buttocks There are several posters of nude women wearing bikinis and exposing bare breasts. There are some sexual references among the soldiers. A soldier's leg is shot. We see a lot of blood around the wound. Civilians and soldiers alike are gunned down and killed. A man punches a mirror and cuts his hand. Blood is shown on his torso as well as on the bed sheets. There are bloody dead bodies shown throughout. The violence in this movie is more brutal than violent. Not as gory or violent as other war films such as Saving Private Ryan. This film is surprisingly not very violent, pretty much moderate. Intense war violence throughout. Accurately depicts wartime during the late 60's A buffalo is seen getting beheaded A man is beheaded. It's all offscreen, but we briefly see his head after it is removed. Marijuana is smoked a couple of times. Cigarettes are smoked consistently throughout the movie. Alcohol is used both abusively and socially used throughout the movie. It is implied a soldier is on acid in one scene Early in the movie, a soldier is seen drinking himself to limit while waiting for his assignment. Colonel Kurtz is an ex commando and he creates his own little kingdom of savage villagers. He's developed a philosophy that savage killing is genius and necessary. This film is very dark and disturbing. The lighter and/or the semi-comedic scenes within the film add a little bit of relief between intense scenes but other than that the entire film is incredibly thought provoking. Rated R for: disturbing violent images, language, sexual content and some drug use The entire film has a very eerie feel. The combat scenes may be intense to some ""Nigga"" is used by black soldiers Very strong language, including abuse of ""Christ"" and ""Jesus."" ""Fuck"" is used 86 times. ""Shit"" is used a few time, as well as uses of words referring to the male genitals, a-words, and uses of God damn/God damnit, and other less swear words.

Very Brief. Bare buttocks can be seen. Blink and you'll miss it. A character is hit with a tire iron in the head. The character then begs for their life but is choked to death by another character. The choking lasts for a good 30 seconds. Once dead, we see a small wound with blood and a lifeless body. The first scene of the film depicts a reversed shooting, with a stream of blood oozing backwards, blood shown on the walls and floor, and then the shot itself offscreen. A man slaps and punches a woman after she makes a remark about his dead wife. A character is injected with an overdose of insulin. Drug dealing is a major element of the film's plot. A character holds a bottle of whiskey and comments about not feeling drunk. We see a woman snort something not known to the viewer; it is most likely cocaine. As aforementioned, we see the before and after of a recklessly-motivated beating; also, the aftermath of a bloody killing is seen. By far Nolan's most profane film, but not ridiculous.

When Marion is getting takes of her bra to get changed, her back is shown in a mirror. No nudity. Indy has a brief fight with a man under a plane. The mans body is chopped in half by the propellers and blood is seen. Two men engage in a brutal fight inside a truck, one is throwing through the windshield, but he manages to climb back inside and throws the other man through the windshield, running him over with the truck offscreen. Indy beats up a man offscreen, and steals his clothes. A man is skewered by a booby trap; we see his bloody remains in a ""jump moment"". There are spears going through his head, and his body. It is slightly graphic, and fairly bloody, but we see it for about a second. A man's body is revealed to have many poison darts in its back. His shirt has bloodstains around the wounds. Bloody. During a bar fight, a man is shot in the face, with spurting blood pouring down his head. Another man is shot in the back of the head and blood dribbles from his mouth (wound not shown). In a market place fight, several men are punched and hit with objects, a man is run through with a sword and then fruit, we see the fruit falling off the sword as it is pulled back through the man. Another man is shot point blank (bloodlessly), and dies. A man is shot while driving a truck, it shows a close up of his hand covered in blood, but not the wound. Two men engage in a brutal fight near a plane, and one of the men is taken out by a spinning propeller (offscreen), splattering blood all over the plane, but we don't see his body. A car is shown being driven off a very high cliff, and the bodies of the men in it are shown to be flailing along side the car as it falls. A man is beaten unconscious by Indy inside a ship. A thug accidentally stabs one of his allies with a sword. Twice in the movie half-rotted skeletons are shown. They are very frightening and in some cases, very disturbing. Marion and Belloq down several shots of liquor and become very drunk. Marion owns a bar, we are first introduced to her when she has a shot competition. A man is seen smoking pipe. Very short scene. Indy is shown drinking in a bar with the monkey. Men in an Egyptian bar are seen smoking hookahs. Karen is shown smoking once and drinking in two other situations. A Nazi is shown smoking, where after he throws the cigarette in a pipe on a ship. A snake slithers through a skeletons mouth. Indy falls into a pit of snakes. Anyone with a phobia of snakes can find this scary. Two men enter a cave and find some big, tarantula-like spiders on one of their shoulders. In a few seconds it turns out one of them is completely covered in them. They get rid of them easily and no-one is hurt, but this scene can be pretty intense to those with arachnophobia. In Marion's bar, Toht orders her seized and approaches her with a red-hot poker to torture for the artifact he wants. For a few baited seconds, Toht is in a closeup relishing the agony is about to inflict, until the poker is suddenly ripped away by Indiana Jones with his bullwhip. A man's hand is burned lightly after touching a piece of warm metal (relic). The aftermath of his hand is shown later. A man is sliced by a planes blades; it is offscreen but blood splatters on the windshield. The first scene is fairly frightening and intense, where Indy finds a man with spears through his body and runs from a moving boulder, among other things. Indy and Marion are shown trying to escape from a room while snakes are threatening their lives. Skeletons are frightening. 1 use of ""holy shit"", 2 uses of goddamn, 2 uses of hell, 1 use of bastard, 1 use of ""son of a bitch""."

She is then brought away into a house on a wheelbarrow and one of her breasts if briefly seen. Fast and could fly over some viewer's heads, only seen for a split second. A naked man is shot in the genitals - blink and you'll miss it After a male slave wins a fight, his owner cheers in triumph and decides to have a female slave sent to his room to ""lick his pole"" as a reward. For a few seconds, you can see parts of a man's butt. A brief whipping scene that is not bloody at all. There are two kinds of violence in this film: gunplay/shootouts, which are stylized and over-the-top, almost cartoonish, with comical amounts of blood; the other type of violence is inflicted upon the poor and the slaves which is rather intense and sad, meant to show the horrible nature of slavery. Violence isnt constant but when it does happen it often gets bloody. A fully-clothed man is shot in the crotch. He screams and flails wildly. This lasts for about 30 seconds. An explosion happens where multiple horse and men die. Then a main character shoots someone and they fall of their horse. Blood is seen on the horse. Django shoots a man in the chest, blood is seen. He then whips another man and shoots him. Then a character shoots a man off his horse and blood lands on some flowers. A man shoots a man in the stomach and then shoots him in the head. Bloody. A horse is shot in the head, resulting in a spray of blood. The horse topples, landing on a man, breaking his leg. A man is tied upside down and it is implied that he is about to be hurt. However, the villain is interrupted before the deed is done. Several men are shown drinking, a lot of smoking is done as well. Not scary or frightening. Just violent and bloody. Most of the violence is towards bad slave owners which makes the violence more satisfying than disturbing. The action and violence is very stylish, unrealistic and even funny, but when the violence goes to black slaves the violence turns more brutal, realistic and very hard to watch The scenes where the violence goes to the slaves are intense and hard to watch Most of the violence in this movie is directed towards slave owners, only a few scenes have slave violence Racial slurs throughout.

A robot thrusts a ""taser"" into another robot for a period of time until he passes out and falls down a garbage-chute. Two robots get compacted into enormous trash cubes and just barely avoid being ejected into space. A robot barely avoids getting blown up when the vehicle he's in is set to self-destruct (but he ends up okay) A robot manages to destroy dozens of robots in a few seconds.  The overall premise of the movie is pretty dark, as it deals with a trash-covered Earth with no life on it (except for the plant). Could be scary for young viewers.

In one scene, a major character is seen
having sex with a prostitute while seated in a chair and she is straddling him. In another scene the protagonist is having sex with his girlfriend. In both of these scenes we see breasts and buttocks. There are two scenes with a major female character taking a shower, and she is shown mostly from the rear. A prostitute undresses she shows prolongued rear nudity A character commits suicide, but it's only talked about. Quite a few of the adult characters smoke during the movie. The major female character is seen taking some sort of drug in a pill form, probably the Aponeuron that she purchases later (a medication that the body converts to amphetamine). It is not clear whether it is really illegal or not - the context is that the state would prohibit her from taking this particular drug but not necessarily because it is immoral. The protagonist and another character are sharing a drink from a bottle. The gentleman has several other bottles there as well. The protagonist lights up a cigarette at this time also. There are several scenes where characters drink cocktails. In one scene two of the major characters are in a quiet bar, and the male drinks two shots of vodka while the female drinks a shot of cognac. There is no scene in the movie where anyone is shown to be intoxicated. One intense scene very early in the movie when a prisoner deprived of sleep is being interrogated and is seen breaking down when threatened with the arrest of his wife and the institutionalization of his children. The film does get a bit depressing at times and has the overall feeling of militant oppression when the Communists were in power. During a class scene of would-be interrogators, taught by a senior and respected Stasi interrogator, a student asks a question that shows sympathy to the prisoners plight. The instructor then makes a mark on the seating chart where this student is sitting perhaps to keep an eye on this student as a possible prisoner sympathizer or of the wrong character to do the job well. The movie dialog is in German with subtitles. There is one scene where an angry character is seen exclaming ""Scheiße!"" and the word ""S***!"" is printed as a subtitle. Otherwise, none."

Non sexual but they are clearly seen for about 10-15 seconds total. These are only paintings however. At the start of the film Jack reads a ""Playgirl"" magazine which is the equivalent of a ""Playboy"" magazine but with men. The magazine is hardly visible. And not focused on The nudity is not presented in a sexual manner. In an awkward scene we can see a man in a bear costume giving another man implied fellatio (not graphic), the scene appears abruptly but ends quickly within a few seconds. Jack calls Wendy a ""sperm bank"". A naked attractive women who is having a bath stands up when Jack enters the bathroom. As she walks towards him there is full frontal female nudity. A man is killed with an axe blow to the chest (bloody but not excessively so). Violent acts are discussed, plotted, and threatened. An elevator lets out a river of blood. This image is shown several times during the course of the movie. No visible injuries are shown to any characters throughout this scene. Overall not a lot of violence especially for a horror film, and the violent moments which do occur aren't especially graphic. There is a scene where you see two mangled dead bodies of girls in a corridor surrounded by pools of blood, as well as an axe. A man smashes down a wooden door with an axe while a woman hides with a knife in her hand. She slices his hand with the knife; blood is briefly visible. The protagonist orders a drink twice; in his past he had problems with alcoholism. A man drinks. A woman smokes cigarettes. It is a very scary film. May frighten most. The scene where a woman finds a room where a man is kneeling down in a bear costume with another man is very bizarre and might creep out some viewers. This film contains disturbing depiction of madness and the effects of cabin fever. It isnt that violent or gory, but it is very terrifying. The score throughout the movie is incredibly eerie and over the top creepy. It applies to the atmosphere of tension, mystery, terror and suspense that sets the tone of the film. The soundtrack is meant to be visceral, disturbing, overlapping, loud, unsettling, maniac, and sudden. The music is what also makes the film very terrifying,very suspenseful & also very exciting to watch but,it might give the audience a headache. Due to its dark atmosphere and creepy tone, this movie gives off an uncomfortable vibe from start to finish. In one scene, a small child is riding down the hall on a toy tricycle and sees two girls' ghosts (and then flashbacks of their bloody hacked up corpses). 10 uses of ""fuck"",10 uses of ""goddamn"",3 uses of ""nigger"",1 use of ""assholes"" and 3 uses of ""son-of-a-bitch"" Jack's language becomes cruder and more profane as his mental state deteriorates. A racist reference is said by a character towards jack and repeated back by Jack. Some minor religious profanity."

There are a few kisses between couples. There are a few kissing scenes The film features extended scenes of fantasy violence and action sequences. There is a big fight sequence with Aliens. Many aliens are killed but barely any blood. The violence in this movie is more intense than any previous Marvel movie. There are plenty of brutal beatings, stabbings, choking, and heavy hitting. Although most of the action is bloodless. The film basically has non-stop action and, unlike most MCU films, it has a dark tone to it and much is because of the spontaneous violence there is in certain scenes. In addition to standard comic book film destruction, characters are tortured, impaled, and beaten. While generally bloodless, the consequences feel greater, and could upset younger viewers. Multiple scenes of stabbing, some of them leading to death, others leading to open wounds, with much of them being immediately healed.  There is a balance between humorous and dramatic moments but Infinity War has a very dark and bleak tone. Characters are attacked by violent alien creatures which may be intense for some. This film is very dark and contains the look and tone of a doomsday movie, with several dangerous situations, many beloved characters seen in previous films dying in the most tragic way possible, intense depictions of terrorism and genocide, a devastatingly tragic ending, and much more action and violence compared to the rest of the MCU films. However there are still plenty of comedic moments throughout. Thanos' extraterrestrial Black Order is frightening. Characters Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, and Cull Obsidian make up the Black Order, and they all have frightening appearances.

Only in the ""Director's Cut"" Version is a brief side shot of a locker that has a nude poster. Breasts are visible. Ripley is shown in a tank top and panties twice during the movie. She is seen in her underwear for about three minutes total. Some of Ripley's pubic hair can be seen poking out of her panties in one scene. Easy to miss. Moderate action violence throughout with death scenes (some offscreen) that contain little or mild blood spurts. No gore or violent death details. A baby Xenomorph is burned to death by a flamethrower. The movie's lighting is very dark, so many of the scenes that contain any gore are hard to see The overall violence is moderate level, so it is not too hard for adolescent or PG-level viewing. An alien attacks a woman offscreen, but you see blood splattering on the windows of the cockpit she was in. Dead corpses are seen wrapped in cocoons; a chestburster alien rips through a living woman's chest. Some blood pours out, although not as much as the chestburster from the first movie. A woman has a dream that an alien bursts out of her; the alien can be seen under her skin just before she wakes up. Several times, people are killed both on and offscreen with minimal blood. A Marine character is seized by an alien and in a panic, discharges her flamethrower, setting her comrade alight. In a blind panic, he accidentally falls over a railing a plummets to his death. In the process, he drops his flaming bag of ammunition, which explodes and throws two other Marine characters. One of them is hurled into a wall and snaps his neck. A Marine character shoots an alien in the head. There are a few scenes where characters smoke cigarettes. The main character Ripley smokes in a few scenes as does Hicks. Apone smokes cigars frequently. There are a few scenes with smoking. The main character Ripley smokes in a few scenes as does Hicks. Apone smokes cigars frequently. The climax is quite intense. The many deaths during the film are quite frightening. Some intense peril and scary creature violence Mild to moderate horror scenes, however the film is more action and adventure oriented rather than 'scary'. Though special and visual effects tend to get outdated in a decade or so and become unrealistic, this film's special effects are done so well they still look convincing. Children growing up seeing only CGI monsters now may be frightened by the aliens ""really"" being present in front of the camera. Several Marines are in danger of extremely scary and vicious alien creatures. The film is more action-oriented than the extremely suspenseful and frightening first film (Alien). There is one intense scene where Ripley and the girl are both in mortal danger of being ""impregnated"" by a crab-like creature that crawls around in an empty laboratory while they sleep. 25 f words in the theatrical version and I think 14-15 in the special edition. 'Godd*mn' is said. 'Sh*thead' is said once. '*ss' is said several times, and 'dumb-*ss' is said once. 'Sh*t' is said many times. 'D*mn' is said at least six times. 'F*ck' is said about 25 times in the theatrical version, and about 15 times in the special edition version."

Punches, kicks, shooting with laser guns, etc. Lots of animated violence, fighting including guns. Extreme physical fights and fighting. Repititive action fighting and violence. Very slight, but visible, infrequent blood on characters' faces during intense fight scenes. No drugs or smoking There are several deaths in the movie that could be intense/sad for viewers. There is a scene that lasts less than five minutes with an animated spider crawling around, which can still be scary to those with arachnophobia. There are at least two jump scares in this film that will startle most audience members. This film has non-stop action violence. While largely an animated comedy, it does contains some fairly dark scenes with character deaths and thematic elements. The final battle is very intense. Scene where a dark and frightening creature enters a space in search of another character. I believe for kids this could be very scary even though animated. It has a nightmarish/anxiety dream quality and the main character (teen) is frightened and hiding. The villain here looks scary and intimidating. Very mild language like ""Hell of a freaking lightshow,"" and ""crap,"" are used. In one rap song, the line ""You got a hat? It's for the ho's"" can be heard, but it may be easy to miss. Damn is used comedically by Aunt May in one scene."

No nudity, but sex is implied. Batman and Catwoman/Selina Kyle share a 3-5 second kiss Several men are shown shirtless in a non-sexual context. Several thugs lower themselves on cables from a large airplane to a smaller one in mid-air; gunfire erupts for an extended period and soldiers die with bloodied faces and chests and the thugs break and cut the smaller plane into pieces until nothing is left. Bane breaks the necks of several people (the bodies drop dead). Bane steals army tanks and uses them against the police and citizens, killing many people (bloody wounds are on the faces and chests of bodies lying in the street). Thugs hold a man down and drain some blood from his body into an unconscious one using a needle and tubing. Thugs shoot up the stock exchange, kill several men and women and tie hostages on motorcycles. Some hostages are freed or rescued. Many police cruisers give chase and are stopped by a large truck pulled across a road. Men are shown hanging by the neck from a bridge in the distance. Catwoman fights off men in groups of 2 to 6 throughout the film with martial arts techniques: a few times, she points a handgun at the head of one of the men and shoots a few others in the head; she rides a huge motorcycle, shoots thugs pursuing her in tanks and SUVs (a little blood), and launches a missile to blow up a stack of crushed cars blocking a subway tunnel. Several kidnappings occur, with pistol whippings that leave men with bloody foreheads and scars. Men are dragged away through the streets, shot and killed (some bloody chests). Bruce is told that he is missing all cartilage from both knees and elbows and we see scars over his kidneys and other damage. Several violent and long fistfights occur between Batman and Bane (both are injured, but little blood is shown); we hear grunts and shouts. A police officer fights off and shoots dead two armed attackers. Gordon is found in a room by Blake, having shot two armed attackers, the gun shots having been heard. Thugs blow up sewers and subway tunnels with hand grenades and bombs that explode in smoke and fire; at one point, the entire city is filled with the dust from falling concrete, fire, smoke and falling buildings, reminiscent of the 9/11 tragedy. Several scenes include rushing waters in a wide sewer system, with two bodies floating in the water. Dead bodies with blood on their heads lie in a hospital corridor as SWAT team members run through carrying rifles. Selina stands beside a large archery target as a huge arrow strikes the bull's eye and she shouts in surprise. Selina somersaults backward out a second-story window to escape capture as a jewel thief and lands on her feet. Bruce is shown falling from a tunnel wall on a number of occasions and is saved by a guide rope tied around his waist. This film is not graphically violent (the camera usually cuts away quickly when someone is injured and we see very little blood), but the fighting and beatings are strong and can upset some people. A man drinks from a glass of whiskey. A man drinks from a glass of wine. A man in an outdoor café drink a glass of sherry. A cocktail party shows glasses of wine on tables. Bane is very dominant and aggressive. Bane's incredibly violent behavior is incredibly disturbing and occasionally shocking. His distorted voice is eerie and his mask can be frightening. Unlike ""The Dark Knight's"" Joker, Bane is less creepy and more menacing. This film is very dark and contains the look and tone of a doomsday movie, with several hostage situations, intense depictions of terrorism and anarchy, and the complete absence of law and order. This is especially true of the fact that this film takes 8 years after the Joker's plot of taking over Gotham City finally coming to fruition. Scenes set within a foreign prison can be disturbing as there are moments of violence and screaming. An angry man yells at a woman. ""You took my wallet! You fff....... you took my wallet!"" (It is implied he was about to say 'f*ck', but it is not heard at all.) 'Sons of bitches' is yelled very loudly. 'D*ckhead' is said once. 'Sh*t' is said once. 'Godd*mn' is said once.

However, she hits him in the head, and he simply leaves. During sex scene close up of bare butt of a woman. A man and woman have sex for 30 seconds. There is a brief shot of her breasts and buttocks. The majority focuses on shoulders up or is seen from a distance with not much detail. A woman's bare breasts are briefly visible in one scene (most of the time she's in the distant background). She's also still mostly clothed. This is not a sex scene. A woman's stomach is shown for a few seconds as something's being written on it. A man's buttocks are briefly visible in a shower. A man briefly masturbates while watching a clothed woman on TV. Only chest up shown. A man tricks another man into playing a video tape of him and a young woman having sex. There's nothing seen (obviously) But we hear their sexual comments and a lot of sexual moaning. Stylized, but graphic violence. Not as violent as many people make it out to be, but still very violent at some points. A man attempts suicide by cutting his wrist in a couple scenes, plenty of blood is seen on the ground. Stock footage of disasters like 9/11 are shown for effect in one scene. A man commits suicide by jumping off a building. He lands on a car, startling several nearby people, but this isn't very graphic. A man rips out several of another man's teeth with a hammer as a form of torture. There is plenty of blood seen and the act is briefly seen up close. Later, he's seen with a very bloody rag in his mouth. In a long, realistic fight scene, a man hits several other men with a hammer while they hit him with several blunt weapons. The men are seen in various stages of pain from blunt force trauma. At one point, the lone man is stabbed in the back and beaten up. He's seen exhausted and covered in blood, and later with bloody bandages. A man attempts to rip out another man's teeth (in revenge for the man doing it to him) but gets stopped before he can. He then hits the man in the head with a bat, and he's seen in great pain. The attempted victim then threatens to cut of the others hand for molesting a woman. A man is stabbed to death with a broken disk by another man, this is hard to see as it's dimly lit, but it's still clear what happens. A man's severed hand is seen briefly. A man gets into a fight with another man, he's violently thrown about a room, against several glass objects. Eventually, the second man is stabbed in the ear with a pair of scissors, destroying his eardrum. Blood is seen leaking out of his ear while he attempts to stab the first man in the neck. He's then shot in the head before he can kill the first man. A man is seen completely covered in blood after another man is shot and killed in front of him. A man shoots himself in the head, this is graphically seen with lots of blood and a bullet wound on his head. Infrequent but very strong, however there are two scenes which are quite graphic but they don't last for more than just a couple of seconds and the worst bits are not shown. Some smoking teenagers are shown smoking. A character gets sprayed with a gaseous form of Valium every night while imprisoned. The opening scene shows the main character in police custody for drunkeness. Other than this there is little to no drug use. A scene of a man having his teeth extracted using a hammer which is really intense. A scene of a man cutting his own tongue using scissors. A man is eating a live octopus raw which can be frighting for some viewers. Most of the torture scenes are offscreen, but sounds and other visuals can make the scenes just as disturbing without the graphic details. The entire film is very dark and depressing and the violent scenes could be very hard for some people to watch. The word 'fuckhead' is seen written on a chalkboard in one shot. NOTE: In Korean, with English subtitles. 3 uses of ""God"", and 1 of ""Lord"". 6 instances of ""hell"". 8 uses of 'fuck', 7 of 'bastard', 6 of 'asshole', 5 of 'son of a bitch', 3 of 'dickshit', and 1 of 'dick', 'cocksucker', and 'shit'."

Several men are fully nude in a mental institution. One man is fully nude with his genitals visible, and other men's backsides can be seen. In the extended director's cut, a woman tries to seduce a man by stripping nude. Her bare breasts are seen briefly in a few shots. A man sensuously kisses the breasts of a woman in a low-cut gown. The theatrical version doesn't include the nudity. When two men open the door, an old man was injured. Blood is shown on his hands. One mild image of blood on a character who has just attempted suicide. Mozart is shown drinking copious amounts of alcoholic beverages. Mozart is seen with a large container of an alcoholic beverage during all of Salieri's concertos. He is intoxicated at the end of each scene due to that.  The theatrical version doesn't include the C word. 'Cunt' is used once. 'Shit' is said three times. 'Ass' and 'piss' are used once each. And a few uses of 'damn' and 'hell.'

However this is almost impossible to see. During arthurs stand up his book show drawings of animated Full Frontal female Nudity Arthur washes his mother in a bathtub but nothing is shown. Probably less than a minute in the movie you see an inappropriate billboard that says ""Strip Search"" with three women that look naked but it's not detailed. Extremely brief images of (somewhat) graphic nudity in the flipped-through pages of a journal. Signs for porno theaters with suggestive titles and pictures. Main character seen with hand down underwear (suggested masturbation). Kissing. Character bathes in a tub (nothing graphic shown). A man is shot by a police officer on the subway. No blood seen. Violence is a theme throughout most of this film, people are shot in the head on a few occasions, with blood splattering. It's not quite horror film levels, but some scenes are particularly shocking. No gore, but some blood with most of the kills, as violence is a vocal point in the movie. This movie is not that visually violent. Its dark tone should be the concern for most people. The film's violence isn't as intense or graphic as it is shocking. The film contains a few shootings and stabbings with brief injury detail. While it's not excessively bloody or gory, it's in your face when it happens and mostly used for impact. The violence is realistic and quite strong, but it isn't very detailed. There's no gore and the blood sprays are mild to moderate, and we also never really see any wounds or injury detail other than the bloodshed present. Extremely graphic killing, with blood spurts/spatters and dead bodies. Guns, shooting, people being shot. Stabbing in throat and eye with scissors. Kids smash a wooden sign in the main character's face, stomping and kicking him when he's down. Bullies beat up the main character, punching and kicking him. Brief strangling. Smothering with pillow. Character is hit by car. Fighting, rioting, shouting. Implied child abuse. Drunk men harass a woman on the subway. Arthur Fleck smokes frequently throughout the film. Three men are shown drunk in the subway. The main character smokes a lot and takes medication. However, neither are used in violent or abusive ways. Frequent cigarette smoking. Main character takes prescription pills. The Joker's first victims are drunk and abusive. This is an incredibly dark, serious movie. It revolves around a man who is mentally ill and has a condition where he laughs uncontrollably, even in serious situations. Throughout the movie, he gains a sick twisted sense of humor that revolves around death and chaos. Throughout the movie the main character is constantly tormented by society and mistreated by pretty much everyone he comes into contact with. He is punched in the face, kicked at while being helpless on the ground, and called names. All of this inspires him to dress up as a clown and become a criminal. The Joker commits several violent crimes throughout the film, and although the violence is not too frequent, all of the scenes in which The Joker commits the crimes are particularly shocking although not too gruesome. 25 uses of ""fuck"" (4 of which are bleeped out on a TV program), and a few uses of ""shit"", as well as milder terms such as ""prick"" and ""asshole"". Several uses of ""f--k"" and its variants, ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""a--hole,"" ""pr--ks."" ""Jesus"" as an exclamation. Middle-finger gesture."

One character kisses another (incredibly brief). Inside a jail cell, two nazi soldiers are shot by machine guns with blood spurts. Another nazi is shot and blown offscreen. One has his throat slit, we see his neck open and lots of blood spilling out. Several nazis are shot up inside a car by machine guns, blood splatters all over the windshield. Insanely bloody, brutal, sadistic, vicious, messy violence throughout. At the end of the film, a man is released and the man who was released shoots a police officer in front of him. All the violence is very frequent and horrific. When it appears, it's extremely intense, detailed and disturbing. Examples include throat slittings, scalpings, gunshots and other incredibly gruesome moments. Unlike the rest of Tarantino's films, this film has unflinchingly graphic and realistic violence, with no exaggerated blood spurts and it's all portrayed seriously. An entire family is repeatedly graphically shot to death while hiding under the floor. We don't see their bodies. A girl survives and runs away covered in blood crying. Several dead men are scalped by other men wielding large knives. These images are short, but graphic in detail as we see bloody flesh and muscle being brutally cut off from their scalps. A man beats a Nazi to death by bashing his head in repeatedly with a baseball bat until his head gorily and very graphically explodes. Although we see this from a distance, it is extremely graphic and gruesome. Afterwards, a man is fatally shot in the back in a brutal manner. There is a brief scene where a man is shown being mercilessly whipped. His back is very bloody. In an earlier flashback, the same man is seen brutally murdering various Nazis by stabbing them to death, strangling them with a wire, and suffocating them. Extremely graphic and bloody. A shootout occurs in a bar. Two men are shot at point blank range in the groin, blood spurts are visible. Many people die afterwards from gunshots and stabbings in this scene. Very bloody and fairly intense. A woman is shot in the leg, but survives. However, she is later interrogated by another man inserting his finger into the bloody bullet hole on her leg. There is lots of blood in this scene. A woman shoots a guy in the back several times. The man then shoots her in the chest several times, and we see lots and lots of blood graphically spurt out of her body and some is thrown onto the camera lens. Both end up being dead with dozens of extremely bloody bullet holes in their bodies, and there are lots of blood pooling on the floor. A ludicrously bloody and disturbing scene. Drinking and smoking throughout. Tobacco use indicates the time period. One scene in a bar where characters are drunk. A man snorts a white powder from a tin. There are lots of brutal bloody violence throughout the film, and while some of it is over-the-top, all of it is extremely realistic as mentioned before, making this quite possibly Tarantino's most violent film by a long mile. Colonel Landa may be funny or frightening for some, depending on the viewer. The atitudes taken by the Basterds (like scalping or the swastika in the forehead) can be seen as intense and horrible, but it has a comedic tone. 22 uses of the F-word Moderate profanity throughout Pretty moderate in comparision with other Tarantino films The film's title is a profanity, but with an ""e"" instead of an ""a"". Probably the mildest profanity in the movie."

Kids won't understand it, but adults will get the joke. It is mentioned that Ernesto De La Cruz's music caused people to fall in love with him Abuela intentionally smashes Miguel's guitar in a heated argument. Alcohol is present. One character drinks a shot. Some tense chase scenes. A character falls from a great height. A murder scene is played out and is sensitive to some viewers. Pepita's roar can startle viewers. Many skeletons lose limbs and their skulls and other body pieces throughout the second half of the movie. Eyeballs also fall through the head into the mouth of one skeleton. Extremely emotional moments, deaths, (not graphic) intense moments, etc. are all over the place. Pretty sad for a kids movie. The finale will most likely make you cry.

None of this is shown, but the implications and discussion. There is implied rape and attempted rape, it never happens and the rapist who attempted it is killed. Brief nudity during a sex scene, sexual dialogue and attempted and implied rape. Murron stands naked in front of William in the forest. Her breasts and nipples are clearly seen for an extended period of time. William Wallace and his wife embrace while naked beside a lake the night after their wedding. The outline of her bare breasts are shown from the side and from the front as she slowly turns. The scene lasts for several seconds and the lighting is dark but can be clearly seen. A man and woman kiss passionately in each other's arms, and then lie upon a bed. They are implied to be nude but are only shown from the shoulders on up. Later, the woman becomes pregnant with the man's child. Scottish soldiers lift up their kilts to taunt the English army before a battle. We see frontal nudity, which includes penis, hair and testicles, but it is from far away so detail isn't really shown. There is a mild reference to male erections in a scene in which William and his friends jokingly talk about making spears ""as big as a man"" to which one replies, ""Some men are longer than others."" The man's father then laughingly says, ""Aye, your mother's been telling you stories about me, eh?"" A woman says her lover talked a lot in bed, and that ""Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for."" A large group of men, and some women and even children, are seen hanging inside a thatch house. This is especially terrifying for a young boy character to see. William cuts off a man's head and sends it to the king. The king reaches inside the box and pulls out the head, freezing in cold shock as he does so. William screams at a charging general on horseback. He then strikes the general's horse in the face with his sword, cutting it down from under him. He then beheads the general in full view onscreen. Very strong violence, highly realistic and a very high body count. The camera is perched by a dead man's bloody corpse. We see the blood and wounds. Graphic. (Deleted. Personal opinions about suitable viewing ages are not appropriate for the Parents Guide.) A couple of violent battle sequences. There is slashing and stabbing throughout and the blunt ends of weapons are often used. Multiple men are hit on the head/face. Sometimes heads and limbs are very quickly chopped off with some blood. In a few scenes, men are shot with arrows and horses and riders are thrown and killed. A man has his face impaled by another man's knife. Several other people have their heads smashed with mallets. A man is thrown from a terrace and falls upon a large wooden spike which impales his torso. Survivors are seen searching among the dead for their loved ones on the field after a battle A brief fist fight and struggle breaks out between English soldiers and Scots villagers; a knife is held to a man's throat. A man is crushed by a ball and chain offscreen. An attempted rape is thwarted by biting and hitting (with a rock). A woman on horseback is struck in the face with a long stick, knocking her semi-unconscious A soldier slits a woman's throat with a knife. (The shot is from the back but graphic sound is heard.) Later, the soldier is punished by having his throat slit in the same manner. The entire act is shown this time, with the bloody gaping wound shown as the man wheezes for breath before dying. A severed head is pulled out of a box in closeup briefly. A man's face is briefly seen smashed by a ball and chain. A man is tortured and killed by stretching, racking, gutting, and beheading. (offscreen for the most part, and more emotional than violent) A young man is hurled from a window, falling to his death. Wallace traps a group of English soldiers in a hut which he then burns. They are shown writhing and screaming in oil before fire is applied to the hut. People are shown drinking. Corpses hang from the ceiling of a room. Very graphic and frightening.

Blood comes out of the mouth of an injured man, he then falls to the floor. Drugs, recreational: None Some characters are seen drinking and smoking in a few scenes. A man goes insane, but later recovers. All scenes where the submarine is bombed are very intense. This feeling is often enhanced with the crew dreading the sound of sonar pings of the Allies' Navy ships, knowing as they get louder and faster, the enemy is homing in on their position to attack. Some distressing scenes towards the end of the film. A few uses of the ""F"" word, sometimes used sexually. Some mild language."

Thor, Korg, and Miek are shown drinking lots of alcohol. This is a dark and bleak film, and despite its fair share of comedic moments, the whole film has the tone, look and feel of a dystopian movie.

This was in order to cross the river. Brief and not meant to be suggestive. Some mild innuendo. A few scenes of the main male character with his arm or arms around a girl. A few offhand references to brothels. Many women wear loose clothing that displays cleavage, but it is not sexual by any means. Many people attempt to shoot a teen girl until after many shots she is shot in the face, however she survives unharmed and the shot shatters a mask she is wearing and does not harm her. Arms get chopped off, and the bone and muscle is shown in extreme detail. Although spread out, it does get quite brutal at times. Although animated, there are several battle scenes throughout the film. These scenes can show human cruelty. A notable scene features samurai raiding a village and slaughtering innocent people. This scene alone features decapitation and several limbs being cut off and man swinging his sword at a woman's back. Her backpack protects her from being killed. A man has his arms shot off by an arrow, and another man has his head shot off with an arrow. The former is seen up close, but briefly, the latter is seen from a distance without detail, but then seen up close with plenty of detail. A man has his arm cut off with a sword, and another man is shot in the chest with an arrow, though little detail is seen and it's fairly brief. Many instances of men being shot with arrows and guns, but blood is not shown. A man is shown being shot with a gun, but the bullet passes through him harmlessly. The wound still bleeds through his clothes. Eventually, plenty of blood is seen leaking all over him and he soon passes out from blood loss. Animals are shot at and bombed with grenades (neither are graphic). A wild boar dies, we see its body burn and deteriorate. A wolf is shot at and we are shown the bloody entry hole of the bullet. The dead (but not bloody) bodies of animals are shown. An elk is shot with an arrow and has blood dripping down it's leg. A massive boar with multiple bloody injuries is shown. A boar vomits out huge amounts of red sickly blood a couple of times in a row. A mythological animal is shot with a gun and there is a brief splurt of blood. Some characters drink sake, as was common in the time period This movie isn't like other Studio Ghibli movies, it's very intense and rather violent throughout, rather than humorous. This Movie is very violent but all violence/gore is animated The film contains moderate violence but briefly. This is Studio Ghibli's most violent and darkest film, even topping ""Grave of the Fireflies"". A creature under a magical curse is covered with a mass of worm-like tentacles, giving it a horrific, spider-like appearance. The opening scene in which the creature is met is very intense, and ends with flesh melting off the creature's bones, leaving a huge bloody skeleton behind it. A character is placed under a curse which appears as a black-violet scar on his arm. As the curse progresses the scar spreads as far as his back and chest; at times it becomes agitated and causes the arm to swell grotesquely. There are some very creepy looking creatures. One character asks if soup tastes like ""Donkey Piss"". In the actual Japanese version, the character simply says that it tastes like hot water. Japanese version: two uses of d*mn English version: About 5 uses of ""damn,"" a few ""bastards,"" 1 use of ""piss,"" 2 uses of ""Oh my God"" Some name-calling, but nothing too bad (i.e. ""wolf girl,"" ""idiot,"" ""moron,"" ""ruler of beasts,"" ""dope,"" ""dumb,"" etc.)"

Full frontal female nudity. Teenage Sex. Two boys photograph a beat cop having sex with a teenage prostitute on a roof; male bare buttocks and thrusting seen. The two boys then proceed to have implied sex with her, one or possibly both being virgins. The main character, when he's a boy. He spreads his legs and shows his penis to a girl, (not shown), then the girl shows him her vagina (not shown), he tries to grab it, but she stops him. Full-frontal female nudity. Topless women. Woman's naked bottom. An older man has sex with a teen girl; his naked bottom is shown thrusting. Teen sex; strong material regarding teens and sex (a boy rubs up against a girl, shows her his privates -- not seen -- and ""pays"" her with pastries in exchange for sex). Man kissing/rubbing his face in a woman's cleavage. A man and woman kissing, making moaning sounds. Sexual artwork on walls. Strong sex talk, strong sexual situations. No graphic adult male or female (genital) nudity shown, but some strong sequences of sexuality. Naked woman lies in hearse as if dead, showing full frontal nudity including pubic hair. Man climbs on top and it's implied they then had sex. A teenage girl prostitutes herself. She is shown having sex with other teenagers and older men Early in the movie a young man and woman are kissing in a movie theater. A gangster pulls them apart so he can see the man's face. He reacts angrily so the hood pulls a gun. With it he pulls open the woman's blouse needlessly exposing her right breast to viewers. There is a closeup of the breast (again unnecessary) . The hood presses the muzzle of his gun into the woman's nipple. In at least one of the rape scenes, the victim wears some type of a modesty prosthetic often used in movies. It is obvious. Robbery/rape victim later meets the gang. They then playfully expose their genitals so she can decide who was her rapist. No nudity is seen (because full frontal female nudity is a-ok, but male full frontal nudity is too much for male viewers). She ends up fondling and kissing some of them after they have redressed. While a young boy watches through a peep hole, a young woman removes her costume and full rear nudity is seen. During a robbery, a man rapes a woman by throwing her down against a table face down. She moans loudly during the rape; thrusting is seen. No explicit nudity. It is implied she is a masochist and enjoys such treatment. When a man looks through a peephole at an adult club women's breasts can be seen just for a brief second. Sexual dialogue and nude pictures. There are two very disturbing rape scenes. The first one is brief, the second one goes on for several minutes. There is a rape scene in a car, we see the woman's breasts and a view of her perineum/vulva as she is lifted up by the rapist is clear though darkened. This scene is very disturbing. A man is shot in the eye. Subsequently, the car with the dead man is raided with bullets by a couple of guys in another car. Later, a man who escaped is shot and killed. Very graphic and disturbing for young viewers. The violence is more graphic than The Godfather and Goodfellas, but not as bad as Casino. A man is punched a few times onscreen, his face is completely dripped in blood (shown for a bit). One of the attackers is later shot in the head, we see a bloody bullet wound with blood dripping down shortly. Only really bloody bit in a 4 hour movie Two boys are beaten by a bunch of gangsters, not bloody but very prolonged and brutal, including heavy blows by brass-knuckles and kicks. A woman is shot twice in chest, a bloody bullet wound is briefly visible before she dies. A character is shot through the eye. Very sudden and bloody. Various other scenes of strong violence. However never much blood is shown. There are two long scenes in a Chinese club where large groups of people smoke drugs A main character is addicted to opium. Several instances of opium smoking, limited to a couple of scenes. Sporadic instances of smoking and drinking. The main characters are involved in the Prohibition business, so pretty much all of the drinking is illegal. All violent scenes are realistically graphic, and the rape scenes are very disturbing. Besides the violence and the intense scenes, this is a very melancholic and emotional film from beginning to end. A teenage prostitute is seen having sex with an older man, but no nudity from her, just the man's bare butt. There are various intense scenes. Cunt is said once during the latter half. 22 uses of ""fuck"", 13 uses of ""shit"", 3 uses of ""damn"", 10 uses of ""ass"", 4 uses of ""pussy"", 3 uses of ""cock"" and a few uses of ""bitch"", ""schmuck"", ""pansy"", ""bastard"", and ""hell"". Also, 8 religious exclamations. There are also many uses of derogatory terms for people of Jewish, Italian, and Irish decent."

This is quite suggestive though not graphic. A man's bare backside is seen as he runs towards his girlfriend, also nude. No sex, some non graphic nudity. There is a long sex scene between two characters with full nudity. A man is seen standing naked in the dark. His hip region is barely visible (editorial comment removed, and is reserved for the reviews sections). A woman takes a bath. Nudity not shown. The violence depicted in this movie is not graphic at all but it is very intense because you may not expect it. Several people are shot offscreen, it isn't graphic and is in a dark setting, but a man is briefly seen with blood splatter on his face afterwards. We see two people putting a body in a trash can. This is brief, and from a distance. Some scenes where people engage in fist fights because of a drug dealer. Four people are seen going through intense emotional suffering. The entirety of the movie is centered around drugs, and the horrors that come of it. Marijuana and cigarettes are both smoked a couple times 2 characters want to make it big off of drug dealing Couple brief scenes where a white powder like substance (presumably cocaine or speed) is snorted through a rolled up dollar bill. People doing drugs is actually rarely shown in the movie, it's more about the lives of people using, and how drugs ruin them. It has a great message that everyone should hear. Other pieces of media centred around drugs show a lot more of it. A show such as Breaking Bad shows a lot more drugs. This shows more of the effects and shows how bad drugs are, and that nobody should use. Though drugs are actually rarely shown, the effects of them are. Such as hallucinations etc. It can be quite disturbing and dark but people realise that the hallucinations aren't real. However, ironically, a heroin addicted character (rightfully) discourages a woman from taking speed. The main focus of the film is the development of drug addicted characters. The drug content sometimes ensues disturbing images. The film is extremely depressing and while the movie goes on it just get worse and worse. Some adult themes and drug use. Can be disturbing. R18+ ( Adult Themes & Strong Drug Use ) Some of the characters are sometimes in pain after fights. This isn't graphic or disturbing but might be intense for some. The drug sequences and hallucinations are intense and disconcerting. A woman experiences gloomy and frightening hallucinations, which become worse as the movie continues. Frequent swearing. 33 uses of ""F*ck. Constant uses of ""shit"", ""damn"", ""bitch"", ""hell"". Words such as ""pussy"" and ""ass"" are used very rarely. Some religious profanities: ""goddamn"", ""Jesus"", ""Christ""."

A single mild reference, for comedic purposes only. Two urinating scenes: 1) A guy warns Rancho ""If you won't came out then I'll piss on the door."" After the count of 10 Rancho shows the spoon to the guy he tries to urinate on the spoon but gets an electric shock on his penis. 2) Chatur tries to urinate on the wall two kids puts a gadget out and the same thing happens. No sex or nudity, but note the following: There is a scene of ragging (hazing) where male students are pulling down their pants to have buttocks stamped. However, no nudity is seen, and it is comic in tone. There is a reference to someone being called gay, and a bit of gay humor (comic in tone, unoffensive). A student slides magazines under the other students' doors to keep them from studying. Only the covers are shown, with women in skimpy clothing. One student is shown stroking his bare chest as he looks at a magazine. An image of man who has hanged himself is shown. Virus beats Rancho to an umbrella and says ""you are a thief"" repeatedly. Two characters get electricuted upon urinating and then scream, this is played for slapstick purposes. Minor references to violent actions throughout but nothing very serious and explicit. A man is seen drinking in a scene. A drunk girl visits the boys hostel. Drugs: None There is a scene in which 3 people are seen consuming alcohol and drunk. The scene is relatively extended, but not serious nor is it particularly dramatic in tone. Several character scream throughout the film, although some of them are displayed for comedic purposes. In one scene, Chatur moans in despair upon being electricuted by two kids, although disturbing, this is meant to be played for laughs. Speech scene: Balatkar (rape) word was used throughout the speech, stan (breast) word was used 3-4 times and the last moment explaination of farting power in sanskrit. Hindi swears including kamina, saala, gadha and many more. Name calling - (virus, silencer). Words like ass, piss, screw and swine are used. They are infrequent, though."

Ken and Barbie fall in love at first sight. A male and a female doll rub noses together and hold hands. A female doll jumps onto a male doll's lap. A female doll complements a male doll's ascot (the inflection could be construed as an anatomical reference). A male doll dances around a female doll suggestively and they then dance together and he dips her while speaking Spanish (not translated) in a seductive tone. A male doll models clothing for a female doll and dances for her while she watches and coos. A male doll and a female doll flirt in a few scenes and practice saying, ""I love you"" in one scene. A male doll tells a female doll ""I'm immune to your bewitching good looks."" A male doll appears to be wearing only boxer shorts. A male doll's shirt is seen open and revealing his bare chest and abdomen. In an extended sequence, several toys struggle to regain their footing after being dumped into a trash compactor at a garbage dump: they narrowly avoid being crushed by two large spinning shredders, only to be placed on the path to a giant incinerator, which is belching fireballs and black smoke and we see the dolls seeming to realize that there is no way out and fearing the worst (the toys are later seen unharmed). A TV is dumped into a garbage dump and lands on top of a toy that is pulled out and is shown to be unconscious (he is seen to be unharmed later). A doll is held down by several other dolls, it struggles to get free, and the other dolls unscrew a panel on the doll's back while it screams. A toy rips the removable mouth off a shouting toy. A pigeon pecks at a makeshift toy, causing it to crumble into three pieces; it is later seen restored. A toy attacks several toys, throws them into a pile and holds them there while yelling. A toy monkey screeches loudly and presses an alarm bell when it sees other toys moving. A toy monkey screeches and hisses at another toy. A dinosaur toy roars loudly at other toys. A large flying toy drops a ""bomb"" of toys -- a Barrel of Monkeys -- on top of other toys, and the monkeys swarm the other toys. Several toys are closed in baskets that look like cages and are watched over by another toy that yells at them and threatens them. Toys are seen being tossed, ripped apart, licked and destroyed by children. Toys shove, push, and karate chop other toys, including a toy kicking another toy and shoving a toy into a sand box, and a toy clamping its arms around another toy's head. Two toys wrap another toy in scotch tape and place it in a filing cabinet drawer. A toy tackles another toy, twisting its head around and later tying it to a paddle forcing him to watch as his clothing is torn to shreds. A toy is seen tied to a chair as if being interrogated by another toy, which is shouting. Toys are shown crying or shouting in panic when they realize they are being abandoned or discarded by their humans. A doll hyperventilates in a couple of scenes when she is afraid. A doll rides on the underside of a janitor's cart, drops off in a bathroom, climbs up a toilet, nearly falling in and then nearly dropping his hat in, then climbs out a window and onto a roof. A toy describes, and we see in a flashback, how he and two other toys were left behind by their human, and when they made their way back they are devastated to realize they have been replaced. A toy clown with a scary face and a deep voice is shown in a few scenes. A large baby doll is shown in a threatening manner in several scenes and in one particularly creepy scene, it is shown swinging on a swing at night staring at the moon until it hears a noise behind it and its head turns around to face backward. Toy trucks with spotlights on them patrol hallways. A toy yells at a baby doll, tells it that it was no longer wanted and rips a pendant from its hands; the doll whimpers, picks up the toy, throws it in a garbage dumpster and closes the lid. A doll slaps another doll in the face and rips a scarf off his neck. Several toys argue in a few scenes. We see a toy with smudges and scratches on its face (resembling bruising) after what is implied to be violent questioning. A toy falls from a kite, into a tree and hits multiple limbs before almost hitting the ground. A dog falls on top of a toy, which struggles to free himself. After having been played with violently, toys are shown putting themselves back together: A dinosaur is missing its tail (he finds it and re-attaches it), dolls have paint on their hair and faces, a toy has pasta and glitter glued to its back and a toy forces other toys out of a hole in its underside. A toy slips and falls in a bathroom and breaks to pieces as another toy jokes, ""Watch out for puddles"" (implying the toy slipped on urine). A toy jokes with another toy saying, ""I don't think those were Lincoln Logs"" (implying the other toy had been around feces). A toy jokes that the smells of trash could be his flatulence. A young child is seen shoving a toy into his mucus-covered nostril. A doll tells three smaller dolls to ""stay out of my butt"" and we see them open a hatch and jump out. In the repair room, A toy elephant who has a cut in his stomach stuffing out sneezes on the people who were trying to fix him.  Later on, we see a toy monkey with cymbals. The monkey may scare some viewers As with most G-rated films aimed at kids, there's always the possibility that some scenes listed here and/or under ""Violence"" might be somewhat suspenseful or unsettling to the youngest of them. As always, however, that will greatly depend on a child's age, level of maturity and tolerance for such material. The toys try to avoid falling trash, including Buzz who rescues Jessie, but throws her aside just as a TV lands on him. He then appears to be dead, but then comes to. In a several minute sequence that's fairly intense at times, all of the toys are dumped into a landfill and then scooped up and dropped on a sorter conveyor belt. The Sunnyside day care goes from playful to frightening. Exclamations (heck, darn), name-calling (idiot, junk, over the hill, crazy, pea brain, landfill, furry air freshener, drooling, doofus, moron, Potsie, imposter, astro-nut, liar, bully, imbecile), toys tease a male doll about being a ""girl's toy."""

Lasts for a couple minutes. Princess Leia is seen wearing a metal bikini for a while. You momentarily get a peek at her buttock and breasts from a few angles. No nudity whatsoever Oola's full bare right breast can be seen as she struggles with Jabba after he starts pulling her chain. Luke throws a skull at a gate switch. Then a huge creature is impaled with the gate spikes, no blood is shown. A large space battle has spacecrafts being destroyed on both sides of the war. A land battle has several aliens and people shot and killed (no blood). Two people are shot or grazed in the arm and hand in great detail. A lightsaber fight between two main characters ends with one's hand being dismembered: no blood. Uniformed combatants are attacked or killed by large machines' laser fires or are beaten and battered by Ewoks. While punishing somebody, a man is lifted up off his feet by a third party, pulled away from his victim as he grunts, and tossed over some railing into a deep shaft. Screaming as he is falling, he explodes nearer toward the bottom of the shaft. A man briefly fistfights with an enemy before flipping him over his back. The rancor is released from its cage (very grotesque looking) and eats a pig guard. No blood, but the guards body is shown being eaten onscreen. Intense. An Ewok gets killed in an explosion. Jabba the Hutt smokes something. Alcohol is implied to be in Jabba's palace. An Ewok can be seen smoking a pipe. While this is the most lighthearted Star Wars film, it's also one of the most emotional, too. Luke faces-off with the Rancor. Luke and his friends are led to the pit of a giant desert monster to be fed alive. Luke is the first to walk the plank to drop from a small craft, but with his friends in position to help him, he twists and uses the plank as a springboard to jump back and begin the battle against Jabba the Hutt's gang. Emperor Palpatine has a deformed visage look, and he has a creepy voice. No profanity

She is initially willing, however, her older brother warns her against proceeding with the arrangement. She is ultimately married off to the man off-screen. There are passing moments in which adults behave inappropriately towards children, however, they reject their advances. A woman while at jail and away from her baby and crying squeezes her breasts and some of her milk pours out. A boy removes the clothing of a female statue so her breasts and nipples become visible. Two old homosexual people are working in a park. One of them talks and acts suggestively. Children are occasionally pushed, shoved, and smacked by adults. There is no dwelling on pain, impact, or injury as these shots appear to have been shot in a shaky manner. An adult character is stabbed (off-camera) by a child, sustaining non-fatal injuries. After the fact, some blood stains are visible on the child's clothing. The mother beats her son up several times. Tramadol shots are produced and sold on the streets. Later, a child is seen doing the same. Men are seen consuming the drug. Also contains occasional tobacco use (including a scene in which children are smoking cigarettes). The film as a whole does not condone substance misuse. Teenagers are smoking including the boy Zain. Kids are smoking In the first scene Contains themes of child abuse, neglect, poverty, family breakdown, child marriage, drug manufacturing, and bereavement which may cause distress. There is a discreet sequence in which a young boy instructs an 11 year old girl, who has just had her menarche, to put on a sanitary pad, and warns her against disclosing her pubescence lest her parents attempt to marry her off. Contains coarse language throughout (much of which is uttered by a child), including the use of ""fuck"", ""motherfucker"", and ""cocksucker"". The film also contains use of milder terms, including ""son of a bitch"", ""shit"", ""piss"", ""asshole"", ""crap"", ""slut"", ""whore"", and ""bastard"". A child uses coarse language whilst entertaining an infant. The coarse language disclosed here is reflective of the subtitles in the English-language version of the film."

Some kissing and implied sex, Clementine and Joel lay under the covers nude however we only see their faces. A man talks about how he stole a woman's panties Overall the film is very tame on all fronts We see a memory flashback of other young kids pressuring Joel to hammer an apparently dead or injured pigeon in a wagon (it's not moving). He hits it several times and one of the kids then bends his arm backwards. Dr. Mierzwiak's wife whacks at Stan for him trying to cover Dr. Mierzwiak's indiscretions. Clementine takes some substances. A woman mentions that she is ""stoned"" after taking some drugs with her boyfriend. Two people smoke a joint at the edge of a bed. Joel asks Clementine if she wants a drink and then hands her a glass of whiskey. The movie has some very loopy and confusing scenes, these may stress some viewers out. This film is extremely emotional and may make a lot of viewers cry. In a few of the surreal dream sequences we see some people with disfigured faces that can frighten some.

James Stewart and Kim Novak make out in multiple scenes. There is no sex or nudity. However, the plot may be considered suggestive for viewers due to the fact it revolves around themes of voyeurism, stalking, and sensuality. (The man is unmarried; the woman is--or seems to be--his friend's wife.) The protagonist's obsession with a dead woman makes his actions in the second half of the film seem necrophilic. But this perversion is never made explicit. The main character cajoles a woman into changing her appearance in order to look more like his dead lover. There is nothing explicit in the scenes but the director described it as a ""reverse strip tease"" since there is a clear sexual component to his desire. The violence is not explicit. There is no gore. In the opening scene, we see a policeman fall to his death from a rooftop. The impact is not shown but the aftermath is shown from a high distance. Madeleine (the female lead) attempts suicide by jumping into San Francisco Bay. Again, the violence of these scenes is in no way explicit. Little drinking and smoking is shown. Early in the film, Scottie (the protagonist) makes a joking reference to drowning his troubles in alcohol. As the film progresses, there is an unstressed suggestion that he really does. At the opening of the movie, we see a woman's eye with the swirling vortex of terror in the pupil. The film is very atmospheric, with music heightening the suspense throughout. There are intense, hallucinatory dream sequences, and a disturbing supernatural theme, of a living woman becoming possessed by a dead one. Mostly mild language. 1 use of darn, my gosh, fool and idiot 3 uses of stupid"

A man and woman are briefly shown having sex; the woman lies on her back motionless and the man moves rhythmically on top of her.

A pregnant woman is shown, from the shoulders to the hips, and we see her stomach grow in a fast-frame sequence. Bare breasts visible. A girl unintentionally calls a porn store, the man on the other end asks if she is shaved and says fur pie doesn't sell well. A time-lapse scene of a pregnant woman is followed by a very jarring scene of the birth-- a close-up of the bloodied infant coming out while pained screams are heard in the background. A woman jumps off a church steeple and lands on another before the scene cuts. It is stated that both of them died. A brief and mild tussle. A slap on the head. People casually and socially drink alcohol. The main character works in a bar; where some scenes take place. People buy and smoke cigarettes. A girl jokingly tells her dad she smoked crack. A quick but very jarring close-up shot of the titular character being born during the introduction, screams are heard and the mother's bloody genitalia are shown.

A doctor and nurse are heard having sex. When they open the curtain the nurse's bare breasts are shown. Alex's room has pictures of fully nude women with breasts and pubic region visible. Multiple lengthy scenes of graphic full female nudity including severe and prolonged scenes of rape and sexual violence against explicitly nude females. Male genitals shown once very briefly. A man's wife stripped by a man whose group of hooligans had forced their entrance into their home. Female nudity, brief side male nudity. This is revisited later in the film, in light of the husband witnessing the scene. The main character imagines that he lives in the middle century age sleeping with maids and about to have sex with them, frontal female nudity is shown This movie takes place in a future society where erotic naked art is commonplace, most of which is surrealist in depiction. Alex has sex with two women in a bed the scene is sped up in a fast forward motion. Rear end nudity is shown and breasts are seen briefly. It's explicit but is in fast motion. There is a lengthy graphic gang rape scene at the beginning of this movie with explicit full frontal female nudity. There is a scene where the main character is shown wanting to grab a woman's breasts (nipples are shown) An old drunk man gets beaten up by a gang. A man gets hit in the groin with a cane then kicked into a river. Another man is tripped then also falls into the river. As he reaches for his hand to seemingly be helped up, he is slightly cut with a dagger although little blood is shown There's a fight between two gangs. They're thrown through windows, hit with bottles, etc. A man gets kicked in the face then in the stomach a few times. His wife is also hit with a cane then gets slapped. A man gets hit in the leg with a cane. A man gets a milk bottle broken over his head. A man grabs another's groin then gets punched in the face. As a result, his bandaged nose starts bleeding. There are disturbing scenes of violence including beatings and murder. There's never any blood or gore, but it's still disturbing and graphic.. Alex enjoys the sight of blood and violence throughout the movie. A few beatings (with fists, canes, etc.) but with no bloody results. A gang of four teenage boys drink ""Milk Plus,"" which is said to be milk laced with drugs such as LSD, mescaline, or amphetamines. Drugs are not shown onscreen. Characters drink wine or smoke in a couple of scenes. This movie is dark and psychologically thrilling. The film is darkly comedic, satirical, disturbing and occasionally frightening. This sex and rape in this movie is very disturbing. It would be offensive to people who have been raped. Because of the graphic nudity, brutal violence, and incredibly disturbing scenes throughout, no child under no circumstances should be exposed to this film. R18+ ( Strong Violence ) The classic ludovico technique scene is extremely hard to watch and may be frightening to most viewers. Near the end of the film, Mr. Alexander tortures a drugged-up Alex by playing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony loudly from the room below. Alex, being in the top room, attempts to commit suicide by jumping out the window, but he survives, though with many injuries. This film is extremely intense and suspenseful at times. A lot of bad language but in the fictional language of Nadsat 13 uses of ""bastard"", 5 uses of ""hell"", 2 uses each of ""shit"", ""damn"" and ""fuck""."

Some scenes with a prostitute where the soldiers say they're gonna have sex with her. Nothing is shown. A man is seen looking at a nude magazine, breasts shown briefly. (This is also very hard to see) It is implied that a man shows his penis to a prostitute. Nothing is shown but it is clear what is happening. It is implied that a prostitute takes turns having sex with several men. Discussed and implied but not shown. Some sexual insults from the drill sergeant People attempting to flee Vietnam are gunned down from a helicopter. Several members of the Viet Cong are fatally executed from a far distance in a destroyed city. A viet cong firing squad ambushes a military base. An intense gun battle ensues between the marine corpse and the viet cong. No one is shot, there is just a lot of shooting and a few explosions. The violence in this film is intense. The violence is not glorified. A lot of war violence, including frequent shooting. The more graphic instances are mentioned below: Drugs: None Alcohol: None Several scenes with people smoking cigarettes. The violence is intense and realistic. While there are brief scenes of dark comedy a lot of the film carries a very dark tone. The first 45 minutes of the film are intense because of boot camp training. The dehumanization of soldiers is a key theme throughout the movie, being shown to varying degrees. This is a very dark and disturbing movie. One particularly racist comment is made by one American soldier to an Afro-American one that ""all niggers must hang."" FMJ has some of the most liberal and creative useage of profanity EVER in the first part of the movie by the senior drill instructor. These include several racist and homophobic remarks. 84 uses of ""fuck"" (some used sexually) and 22 uses of ""shit"" (along with at least 5 uses of ""bullshit"" and 1 use of ""shitty""), along with at least 5 uses of ""ass,"" 11 uses of ""asshole"" and ""hell,"" 5 uses of ""son of a bitch,"" 1 of ""Jesus Christ,"" 1 use of ""whore,"" 1 use of ""cocksucker"" Most of the profanity is used in the first 40 minutes of the movie, where the bulk of Gny.

Nothing graphic shown or addressed. Sexual suggestive dialogue is said at various times, some including words like ""intercourse"" and ""deflower."" Hamilton is playfully referred to as ""the tomcat."" The majority of a scene detailing a character's affair is merely narrated, but includes descriptions like ""she led me to her bed/ let her legs spread."" Aaron Burr casually admits to an affair he is having with a married woman. He later has a daughter with her. (Though not depicted in the play, historically he did marry the woman after her husband was killed in war.) Nudity: None The battle scenes are not portrayed as violent as they are only expressed through dance. As the film is of a theatrical production, all of the war and battles scenes are minimally depicted and mostly narrated. Nothing more than blood and wounding are described. No prop blood is ever used. Historically accurate prop guns are used. Shooting is represented only through sound effects and a dancer miming a slow motion bullet. Dueling is established as common (and legal in some situations) and occurs between several pairs of characters, major and minor. No blood when violence occurs, very family friendly At points throughout the film, characters are seen drinking in a bar. Alcohol is seen in glasses during a wedding scene. Hamilton accuses Thomas Jefferson of ""getting high with the French"" during a debate. Smoking: None Strobe lights are used in a few scenes which may not be suitable for viewers who are seizure prone. Swearing infrequently occurs throughout the musical in 3 songs, including abuses of ""Christ"" and ""Jesus."" One of the songs (Yorktown) mutes the use of the 'f' word. There is an implied 'f' word during the song ""Say No to This"" but is never finished being said. Multiple uses of ""sh*t"", ""damn"", ""ass"", ""bastard"", ""hell"" and ""whore"". References to *f***"" are suggested but never explicitly said. One use of ""prick"" meant as an insult. Mild swears including ""damn"" (9 uses), ""hell"" (4 uses), ""piss"" (3 uses), and ""ass"" (2 uses) heard throughout. And some strong language including ""Sh*t"" and f**k the word cuck is also used once. Hamilton says: Sit down John YOU FAT MOTHER F-*bleep* Several uses of G.D. Two censored F-words in the show, four censored in the movie. Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down): ""When you knock me down, I get the f**k back up again."" Say No To This: ""You see, that was my wife that you decided to fuuuuuu..."" Washington On Your Side: ""Southern motherf***ing democratic republicans!"" We Know (same as Say No To This): ""You see, that was my wife that you decided to f- Whaaaaaaat? Not in all songs, but in a lot, there are a lot of cuss words.

The closest we get is a man and a woman in bed and snuggling, with some female nudity. Sex in that scene is implied but not shown at all. Suggestive incestuous dialogue near the end of the movie. We see a man and woman lying on a bed together. Both fully nude. They are not having sex at the moment but they're about to, only to be interrupted by a phone call. We see the woman's bare back, legs and buttocks from behind a curtain and then get a clear view of her bare breasts and nipples. No male nudity since he's covered by a sheet. A man is seen half covered with a sheet, with a woman who kisses him. No male or female nudity is shown. Not graphic. Women are seen in suggestive clothing throughout. Some sexual references and dialogue. Full frontal female nude bronze statue in an office. A man is shot with a shotgun by another man in the head offscreen, and all we hear is the body falling. A couple of scenes are pretty graphic. There are lots of shootings in this movie but none of them are overly graphic. The Chainsaw scene is the most violent but all you see is a mild amount of blood spraying onto Tony's face. The final shootout is violent but not too bloody. The movie gets progressively darker and more violent as it goes on, with the exception of the chainsaw scene near the beginning. A man is stabbed in the gut. We only see the aftermath. A man has his arm and leg cut with a chainsaw. This isn't directly shown but we do see close up of his eyes and blood spraying everywhere. It is still pretty disturbing and graphic. In the subsequent gunfight four people are shot and killed. A man is graphically shot in the head and chest. Blood spurts and sprays after each shot. A man is hanged from a helicopter up in the air. His body is severely bloodied. It is fully shown, but kind of blurry. A man shoots a drug lord dead. No blood. A man shoots a corrupt cop in the gut and then in the head. Some blood. A man shoots another man in the chest, killing him. A blood spat appears on his shirt. A man shoots another man in the head in a car. Some blood splatters on the window. A woman is mowed down with a submachine gun. Bloody bullet holes form on her chest. A man is shot multiple times. Bullet holes form and blood spurts out of his body. Many men are killed in an explosion. Drugs can be seen frequently but they are only used a couple times in the movie. Cocaine, however, is used a ton, especially in the second half of the movie, mostly by Tony and Elvira. Cocaine is snorted constantly throughout the film and bags of it are seen as the main character is the leader of a drug cartel People are seen drinking wine and smoking at restaurants/clubs. A couple graphic scenes of violence, most notably the chainsaw scene and shootout at the end of the movie. The chainsaw scene is graphic. The entire last hour of the film is very intense and violent. Appropriate rating would be: R for strong bloody violence, pervasive language and drug use, and some sexual content. There are also Spanish vulgarities uttered such as 15 uses of ""coño"" (cunt), 2 uses of ""maricón"" (faggot), and 1 use each of ""pendejo"" (asshole), ""puta"" (bitch), ""culo"" (ass), and ""cabroncito"" (little bastard). ""Fuck"" is said 207 times."

Sex is implied (though never shown) Shocking depiction of child prostitutes. Isn't glorified in any way. Iris pimps tells Travis some of the things he can do to Her, is very disturbing knowing how things like that happened during 70s new York There is a scene where a man goes into a porn theater. The screen is not shown. At one point you can see it blurred in the background. Not graphic. Moans are not heard. A man has his fingers blown off by a gun. This is very graphic although brief. A man is shot in the face several times with a small caliber semi-automatic pistol. The bullet strikes are shown in graphic but brief detail. A man is stabbed through the hand with a knife, he screams in pain. This is very graphic and bloody but brief. A man is shot through the head with a pistol that is pressed directly against his face, blood and possibly some brain matter splatters onto the wall behind him. (probably the most graphic part) A man shoots a robber in a store. A small entry wound is seen and another man starts beating his corpse. A man purchases weapons from an illegal dealer and is shown aiming a pistol at two people on the sidewalk from a high window. This movie contains highly realistic and graphic violence but it is infrequent. This film really isn't that violent until the end where it becomes unexpectedly and realistically graphic. A man shoots another man in the stomach. He is later shot again in the chest and we briefly see a circle of blood on his shirt. We see a bloody wall, bloody footprints, another wall that is particularly gore-covered, and a few gory corpses. This is very graphic. The protagonist regularly takes pills presumed to be amphetamines and drinks a bottle of alcohol he carries when walking down the street. The 12-year-old prostitute smokes and refers to being high at one point. A 12-year-old girl briefly smokes a cigarette and uses it as a timer. An illegal firearm dealer offers the protagonist drugs, but the protagonist does not accept any. Very mild Characters drink and smoke. The depiction of a child prostitute may be disturbing to some viewers. The movie portrays a man's declining sanity as he deals with existentialism. His actions throughout are extremely disturbing and throughout the movie he becomes more unhinged and disturbed.

A female housekeeper who is asked to take care of an elderly, non-related man with Alzheimer's disease, calls somebody, asking if it would be a sin to help him change his pants (as he has soiled himself). When told that it would not be considered a sin, she changes his pants off-camera. A woman is forcing her daughter to come and live with her after a quarrel with her ex-husband.

She runs out of the room, with her shirt undone. ~23 minutes The majority of the film consists of shootouts and gunplay, as the main character is forced to use lethal force against the bad guys. Many characters die from gunshots, and there is a fair amount of blood but never any gore.

The main character is briefly shown smoking a cigarette, and he takes a sip of an alcoholic drink, then puts it back on the tray. Two men walk in on a man finishing snorting cocaine.

Some of the scenes in which soldiers are missing limbs can be easily missed, until the end, in which hundreds of soldiers with gory and brutal wounds are scene. Compared to many other modern war films the brutality of war is not focused on as this film as it concentrates on the emotional impact of violence rather than graphic. Though note this film still has its has a few intense graphic scenes. A plane crashes in a very intense but not very brutal scene. There is a war scene, soldiers are seen being attacked by bombs and guns. Two soldiers fight onscreen. There is punching, kicking and choking. It is dark with nothing graphic seen at all. A brief standoff of two soldiers shows one bloody soldier on the ground. Brief moment. A scene across no mans land shows some corpses with bloody wounds. We see a lot of dead bodies with large open wounds on their backs and chests. A scene near the end of the film shows a field hospital with many soldiers with severe wounds. A soldier missing an arm, and several soldiers missing pieces of their legs are shown. Camera does not focus on these injuries, however they are in plain view for 10-15 seconds. While helping a fellow soldier, one gets his hand punctured by barbed wire. Dead and decomposing horses are shown, with accompanying visuals and sounds of swarming flies. Bodies of dead soldiers are shown floating in a river. Several bodies are bloated from exposure to the elements. Majority of the violence in this movie is seen only in aftermath such as rotted corpses, injured soldiers and scattered limbs across the battlefield (No Mans Land) Most of the violence is just dead bodies and wounded soldiers. A body is carried with blood absorbed on a cloth on a dead soldiers eye, implying he was shot in the eye. The film doesn't necessarily focus on the violence, but it is more of a background noise. Their is only one scene of combat and two injuries with both include blood, other than that the film is far more intense than violent. There are some gory wounds during the last 20 minutes, nothing too severe though Many corpses from the war are visible. Lieutenant Leslie is seen smoking a cigarette just as he blesses the two soldiers before they go over the top. A German soldier (only seen from afar) is heavily drunk. A soldier in the troop transporter lights a cigarette. Drugs: None The entire film is made to look like one long continuous take so it's always intense. A lot of the violent scenes are intense. There is a scene where a soldier is being chased by shooting enemies which is quite intense. The music adds to this dramatic atmosphere throughout the movie. Intense violence. However any such gory impact is rarely Seen. Mostly the after-math, some are disturbing containing limbs removed disemboweled and such relative. A bit grissly but brief. Brief shot of a man with a missing leg not disturbing but slightly bloody Very intense film. It keeps you at the edge of your seat at all times. More intense than violent. The main characters rarely actually shoot their guns. 7-9 uses of ""Jesus"", less than 5 uses of ""shit"", a few uses of ""bastard"", a few uses of ""hell"" Around 11 uses of ""f**k"" scattered throughout. However, it is understandable considering it is a war film. Tamer than ."

Once scene in a bed. Another scene in a nazi party In the middle of the movie, a man receives a call and is in bed with a woman whose breasts are exposed. In the second half of the movie, a party with Nazi soldiers is shown that had several women with exposed breasts. A man is shown in a room with a half-naked woman whose breasts are exposed. All of these scenes are very brief and non-sexual. Most of the violence takes place offscreen; however, there are instances of graphic violence throughout the movie. Soviet troops attack German positions with sub-machineguns, tanks and infantry. Some of the battle scenes are intense despite there aren't a lot of'em. An old man is hanged, due to the new order that no one should retreat. This scene is fairly intense One man shoots himself in the mouth and blood splats all over the wall. A soldier is shot through the head and blood sprays out. A few other people are shot, but not too graphically. In a make-shift hospital, amputated limbs are seen in a bowl on the floor. Blood is seen everywhere. Many of the main characters shoot themselves and their wives, however this is either done offscreen, or when the camera pans away from the shooting. Shots are heard. The bodies of two characters who shot themselves are carried away while their children look on. The children do not realise what has happened. A character is shot, this is bloodless although we do see the character collapse to the floor. There is heavy drinking during the movie. It is implied that a man is snorting cocaine. Smoking occurs sporadically throughout the film. Hitler's Dog is forced to ingest Cyanide pills as it cries. Disturbing if you are an animal lover. The whole movie is extremely intense, as it's meant to show the horrors of war. The scene where Hitler commits suicide comes out of nowhere and is very disturbing. One scene when a group of children are killed with cyanide pills is the pinnacle of the films disturbing nature. The amputation scenes may be extremely brutal to some (there are two or three but one is off screen). On two of them you can see the surgeon using knives to cut through their arms or legs and since morphine is scarce they did it without any anesthetics (they scream in pain and one screams for his mother). Almost none; a few minor cuss words (since the film is in German, the words can be seen on the subtitles). 2 uses of Nigger/Nigga, 1 use of fuck, and 1 use of s*** intended to be the pronunciation of some German words heard in the film.

It is implied that a man rapes a woman. He is seen for a split second removing her nightgown; there is a brief nipple flash in both scenes, and easily overlooked. In a later flashback to this same scene, the rape takes place. A man approaches a door and listens to a man and a woman giggling and moaning implying they are having sex. The man then walks in and we see a woman holding her breasts, and nothing is shown. Much More Action Than Fistful Dozens of men are murdered in various ways but there´s almost no blood. A man is stabbed in the stomach but it's not shown. A man is stabbed with a long knife. Not explicitly shown.The knife is seen sticking out of his back but no blood. A man in a bedroom is shot multiple times in the chest with a rifle. His dead body rolls to his back and there is absolutely no blood or entrance wounds. A man's wife and baby are shot. (OffScreen) A man is shot in the head and the bullethole is shown in his forehead with blood trickling. Another man is shot in the head and is shown to be an exit wound. The bullethole is shown in the forehead and the back of the head. Two characters take a beating from a gang but no blood is shown. A man is shot and killed and his dead body is shot a few more times (offscreen) Eastwood smokes for most of the movie. The main villian smokes marijuana cigarette in a few scenes. Men regularly drink hard liquor at saloons. A baby is murdered. While it is offscreen, we still hear the gunshot, and it can be very upsetting to some viewers. Eastwood and Van Cleef are beaten by thugs, but not very graphically.Whilst the beating takes place,the main villain is laughing psychotically and his men start doing the same. The main villain is portrayed to be mad, and some of his behaviour is disturbing as he takes pleasure in murder. Flashbacks of a rape may disturb some viewers. Damn is used a couple times. Son of a b***h is used 1 time

Rachel's nipples can be seen poking through her shirt fabric a few times throughout the movie. The first is when Batman rescues her from Scarecrow's secret laboratory where she is wearing a thin purple blouse and the second at the end where she's wearing a silk shirt. Two women swim nude in a hotel pool. However, only their shoulders are shown above the water. A man is shot in the back by a corrupt officer and it is implied that his corpse is dumped into the river. There is mentioning of Falcone slashing his wrists while in prison. He is shown with bandages on his wrists. An escaped convict menacingly approaches a woman and child. He raises a knife to strike at them before being stopped. Batman ensnares a corrupt cop and interrogates him in a tense scene, threatening to drop him from a high height. Batman is set on fire by Scarecrow during their first encounter and falls from a high building. A criminal is urinating in a bathroom but then Batman appears behind him and smashes his head against a mirror, knocking him unconscious. Batman attacks a group of fiends. He grabs one man by the arm and uses his gun to shoot an oncoming attacker in the foot. Then he grabs another crook and flies off with him as the crook screams and fires wildly. A lost boy asks a corrupt police officer for help, but the officer pushes him back. Batman falls into a street full of people who hallucinate him as a monster whom they attack. He manages to escape them by shooting a grapple onto a speeding train. As he flies off, one of his attackers hangs on but lets go too late, falling from a great height. Batman battles a troop of Ra's' henchmen. He beats several of them down, and throws another off a balcony before being attacked by the remaining one. They both plummet off the balcony smashing through structures on the way down. The train crash is very destructive and smashes through numerous structures leaving a devastating trail of mayhem in its wake. A burning beam falls on Bruce Wayne, knocking him unconscious. His stomach is later shown with blood on it. Strong Intense Violence but bloodless and non-graphic In the beginning, a young Bruce Wayne, while hiding from Rachel in a boarded up well, ends up falling down the well when the wooden boards break. (He is rescued by his father, and it's implied that he broke or fractured his wrist and/or arm.) Thomas and Martha Wayne are shot in front of Bruce There's a fight between several men in a prison. One's leg is broken. This is not as violent as many larger scale comic book films, this is a small scale crime thriller and even the way the action is shot is just fists flying around with tons of shaky cam, some aspects of a horror vibes throughout though very fake looking In the opening scenes, Bruce's master Ra Al Ghul challenges him to a sword duel on thin ice. We see them fighting and minutes later, Bruce falls through the ice. The Scarecrow's gas spreads across a mailroom which poisons a group of people. (We see them falling to the ground.) In order to get Rachel, poisoned by the Scarecrow's fear toxin, to the Batcave in time to save her, Batman is forced to elude the police in an extended chase over and through the city, which requires considerable property damage and disabling many police vehicles. People drink champagne at a party. One of the criminals in the movie uses teddy bears to ship drugs. There is a scene when a woman is attacked by fear gas, leading her to see her biggest fears When fear gas spreads through the streets, people see terrifying hallucinations and there is a moment in which an infected man bites into another man's head. The sound of screaming and crunching is heard here. James Gordon pleads for backup, but the Commissioner tells him that there is no one else to help him. However, at that very moment, Batman in his Batmobile leaps into the emergency to help. Scarecrow sprays Batman with fear gas. Batman then hallucinates many bats tearing their way out of Scarecrow's mouth. This scene is very creepy and disturbing. There's a scene where Batman sprays Scarecrow with his own fear gas. As Batman interrogates Scarecrow, he hallucinates him as a frightening bat-like demon with a growling voice and black bile coming from his mouth, terrifying Scarecrow. This part is pretty unsettling and creepy. Several intense and frightening scenes throughout. The Scarecrow's voice sounds very menacing and may disturb young children. The first 20 minutes may be emotional. Goddamn 12 uses of hell 7 uses of damn 1 used as goddamn 1 use of shit and asshole ""asshole,"" ""shit"" (mumbled in a car)"

It deals frankly and honestly with the effects of dementia and uses a disorienting and fragmented narrative. The ending is probably the most hard to watch scene in the whole movie and it definitely will make viewers cry. Two uses of ""fuck off"" as well as inconstant use of the words ""shit"" & ""bastard"".

Tony throws a towel on him to cover himself. (Implies sexual content between main character and another man) Couple of kisses between Tony and his wife before he started his trip and after he returned with the doctor. Tony mentioned to the doctor that in Pittsburgh ""all the women there had huge tits."" One of the main characters is a meaty bruiser who tends to solve problems with his fists.

He's seen staggering and having to be helped back to his hotel, where he has trouble remembering what room he's in because of how drunk he is.

Sex scenes with female nudity. Although there are quite a few scenes. Pretty much every scene is very short and lasts about 5 seconds. An orgy takes place on a plane. Still very comedic. Also it's not too graphic. A man is shown lying nude on his stomach while a woman is about to sit on top of him. It's very comedic and not graphic A woman teases a man though you do not see anything. This is while two other men watch from a CCTV camera. Not graphic at all. A man has sex with a woman in a bathroom. Lasts for about 3 seconds. You can see her butt. A woman enters a room naked where she has sex. A man gets a blowjob from a woman in a glass elevator (only the movement of her head is seen). Several people down below can see it happening and applaud him. Very funny and not graphic whatsoever. A married couple has sex. You do not see anything. During a monologue a woman's head is bobbing up and down while a man is driving. Not graphic at all and lasts about 3 seconds. Prostitutes are hired at a work party. A man snorts a line of cocaine off a woman's breasts, though she's clothed so you cannot see it. In another scene, he does cocaine with a stripper. Some sexual dialogue throughout. A man lays on the couch of a yacht while several women wearing skimpy clothing throw money at him. Not graphic. A conversation about masturbation happens A woman tries to have sex with a man who was on drugs. This scene lasts about 10 seconds and nothing happens. Since a lot of the movie is narrated, when sex scenes occur you can only see some of it. And you don't really hear it. There are quite a few of sex scenes and most of them go on for a very short time. In this movie there a quite a few sex scenes thought they are short and varies in how severe they are. Most are mild. A man and a woman have sex on top of a bed full of money. In a boat several completely naked women are seen Cocaine is blown through a funnel in a female's anus There's a terrifying storm at sea that nearly capsizes a yacht. Characters fight amongst themselves quite often, with enraged screaming and yelling, and occasional hitting. There's an interrogation scene in which a character's bashed in the face, followed by sprays of blood. In the opening scene, traders play a cruel game in which they toss dwarves at a big target. A major character chokes and stops breathing for a moment but is rescued. A husband and his wife argue bitterly, she hits him in the face and he hits her back. Later, she tries to hit him again, and he then punches her in the stomach, leaving her lying on the floor. A man drives in reverse slamming into a brick pillar, he receives a bloody cut on his forehead. A man punches another man in the face three times and blood spurts from his nose onto people's faces.

While a character is using quaaludes he is listing the certain types of phases that he goes through. A man snorts from a big pile of cocaine that was hidden in his couch. Lots of people are shown doing cocaine at a pool party Infrequent smoking. A man is shown blowing cocaine many times.

A man snorts cocaine with a rolled up dollar bill A close up of a mans nostril is shown as the puts a spoon with cocaine in his nose and snorts it A man snorts coccaine with a stripper. The main character's a drug addict. He's seen drinking alcohol to excess, snorting cocaine, and taking all kinds of pills, but extra time's spent on his favorite: Quaaludes. The movie describes the effect of taking Quaaludes, and one sequence is dedicated to a memorable night in which he takes an extra-strong dose. The character's closest friend is also a heavy drug user. Cigarette smoking is shown, as well. At the end of the movie, it's suggested that he's cleaned up and become sober. Several main characters are highly dependent on cocaine and quaaludes, and are often shown using them. A man gives a lengthy monologue about how many drugs he takes with flourishes of his arms and big smiles, typical of coke users. A man is seen snorting cocaine off of a woman's bra. Two men smoke freebase crack and behave ebulliently. Characters are shown drinking in a number of scenes. The movie, for the most part, is a dark comedy; as it deals with topics involving criminal activities on the stock market (hence the eponymous title) and associated sex over indulgence and drug addiction. The scene where Jonah Hill almost chokes to death is pretty intense. The scene where the guys hold the butler over the balcony may be frightening to some viewers All of the party scenes involve extremely reckless and dangerous behavior. We see a plane explode right in front of Jordan looking through the window of a ship. He adresses three people died inside and the scene is pretty dark. Rated R18+ ( Strong Sex Scenes, Drug Use, Adult Themes & Frequent Coarse Language ) this movie is definitely for Adults. 'F*ck' is said a total of 569 times. Regularly used as a part of normal conversations, is said in explicit fashion, and more than half come from Leonardo DiCaprio's character. 'Sh*t is said many times. Donnie Explains to Jordan how he called the Plane Captain the ""N"" Word, however the word isn't actually said.

Several sequences of strong battle violence with large glorious blood sprays. One very formal drinking scene to celebrate the outcome of a hunt right in the beginning of the movie. Just one cup of sake (presumably) is consumed by each attendant. There are scenes that are full of blood and total carnage Some of the battle scenes may be intense Battle scenes may be frightening. Some light profanity - damn, ass, etc.

No nudity at all, all we see is thrusting, and gasping. They're also very sweaty. The woman is later seen in her underwear. A woman takes off her dress. You see her bare backside and the side of one of her breasts (nipple included). This is less than a second. Two scenes which imply oral sex; neither are graphic, and both scenes cut away before anything happens. Women wear lots of outfits that show cleavage. When a woman is changing clothes you see her butt Several dead bodies are shown with bloody bullet holes. They are surrounded by pools of blood. A dead body has a very bloody chest bullet wound. A pimp is beaten, blood on the nose and mouth. A few bloodless punches and pushes. A woman is shot in the head three times. The perpetrator tilts her head to the side and blood is shown coming out of her mouth. A man is shown getting beaten up in an alley. Most of it is offscreen. A car blows up and kills a man inside. A dead couple has very bloody bullet wounds. Two cops shoot a man and we see blood spurts. Blood is shown pooling out onto the side of the road. A man gets briefly injured in a car bombing. Some blood is on his face and his arm is completely burned. A man's hand is slammed viciously with a hammer. Two gangsters are attacked and brutally beaten. Bones in one of the victim's bloodied face are heard cracking as he gets repeatedly hit with metal baseball bats whilst helpless on the ground. The same man's lifeless body is stripped of clothing and thrown into a hole. His brother is screaming and crying throughout the scene. He is then hit on the head with a baseball bat and we see blood gushing out of his forehead. Later we see his entire body also stripped down, and covered in blood and bruises. Still breathing, he is then tossed into the same hole, and the brothers are buried in quicklime. You see the second victim stop breathing once the soil is shoveled onto his face. A man is violently stabbed in the neck with a pen several times (blood briefly squirts in closeup) and then kicked multiple times and stabbed some more around the upperbody, he is offscreen after the first seven stabs. We see the attacker with a bloody pen-holding hand for several seconds. An extremely bloodied and beat up gangster has his head tightened in a vise. It is implied that he was tortured for two days. His eye bloodily pops out of his head for a split-second. Blood briefly spurts from his mouth, running down his cheeks. His throat is then slit with a switchblade (seen from a distance). This scene is graphic and disturbing A man is shocked once with a cattle prod and has his hand smashed a few times with a hammer in close up, he screams multiple times. Blood trickles out of his hand. He has a very bludgeoned wound on his hand and blood is shown on the table. Several shootings, not overly violent, although a few bloody bullet wounds are seen. Two women are included, one is briefly riddled in the chest with bullet wounds and the other is shot in the head a few times with blood dripping out her mouth. The most violent scenes are the brutal beatings A man is hit on the head, and has a bag put over to suffocate in his blood. Cocaine is snorted multiple times, including one case in the presence of a child. Alcohol is occasionally drank. People smoke and drink in bars on several occasions. Frequent cigarette smoking. Robert De Niro's character smokes in nearly every scene he is in. The vice scene is one of the most graphic scenes in the film, as a man's head is forced into a vice and is tightened until his eye pops out, then he begs for death. What makes it even more disturbing is that its based on a real event. A rather disturbing scene is when a man finds his daughter tied up to a bed and locked in her room. Joe Pesci plays a very disturbing character who could become violent at any time he's onscreen. Rated R18+ ( Strong Violence & Strong Coarse Language ) This is easily Martin Scorsese's most violent film, with the violence being extremely realistic and graphic. The pen scene is rather hard to watch, particularly when the kicking starts, since the attacker is known for hard blows. Profanity throughout each scene. 438 uses of ""fuck"" and most of it comes from Joe Pesci's character One use of ""cunt"" (non sexually) A few uses of bitch A few N words"

Female silhoutte Is briefly seen naked, buttocks brielfy seen A creature bites off the head of a fairy. A lot of shooting throughout the movie. An injured man has his leg amputated. The saw is seen on his leg but the movie switches scenes before anything occurs. A man is hit repeatedly in the face with a bottle. We see his nose getting smashed into his face with bloody results. By far the most violent part in the movie but it's shown in quick shots that dont linger on the impact for too long. A man who has been tortured is shown tied to a post, his face covered in blood. We see that one of his hands has been sliced almost completely from side to side so that his fingers are nearly severed. He is clearly in pain and begs another man to kill him. A man's badly gangrenous leg is shown, and we see the first cut, but no blood, as a doctor begins to amputate it. A person's mouth is cut from the inside using a knife. Not too graphic. The impact isnt shown very clearly. A group of soldiers are shot, some blood sprays from the impacts. A man's face is repeatedly hit with a bottle; his nose caves in and is driven into his skull. He and another man are subsequently shot dead. Tobacco is shown in boxes for rationing. A man drinks alcohol in a few scenes, and men and women drink wine at a dinner. A man smokes in some scenes. A doctor gives a man an injection of something that will painlessly kill him. The Pale Man scene is intense. Some of the violence is intense. The entire movie has an eerie and dark feel. Language is very infrequent overall. 4 or 5 uses of 'fuck (1 'motherfucker') and 'son of a bitch', 2 uses of 'shit', and 1 use of 'bitch' and 'asshole', as well as 5 instances of 'damn', 2 uses of 'God', and 1 use of 'Jesus,' all in Spanish.

In a scene, a man explains that someone's genitals were longer than the barrel of a gun he carried- which earned him a crude nickname. In the opening scene, a man and woman are shown having sex with sounds and movement, it is in the dark and both are semi-clothed, therefore no nudity is shown. When they are interrupted, the woman's bare legs are shown as she puts on her dress. The interruption: a man threatening a woman with knife in the brothel. No nudity. Brothels are a major plot device, but is not used as a way to sexualize the story, rather to advance the plot. The violence in this film while brutal, is not overtly or physically gruesome and is more emotionally charged and frightening than much else in their heavy depictions of turmoil and strain in execution. Many scenes are shot in dark lighting, making the blood less visible. A prostitute is cut several times in the face (with bloody results) until a man holds a gun to the head of the attacker. Two brutal beatings. The first one slightly more violent than the other. In both, the victims' faces are bloody. A man's face is seen bloodied for some time. A large gun fight occurs in a bar lots of men killed with some bloody results e.g. a man is shot in the neck blood clouds, a man is shot in the back blood sprays and so on. You see the aftermath of the shootout with a brief close up of a man covered in blood. A man shoots a wounded man moaning in pain(bloody). A man is shot in the head with a shotgun (heard but not seen). A man is whipped on the back (bloody scrapes are briefly visible). We are later told this man died (offscreen) and further on we see his body outside the saloon twice (with a little blood on the shirt). William has a slightly bloody nose after his horse throws him. A horse is shot. The rider has an offscreen broken leg and is shot once in the stomach afterwards with a bloody bullet wound and some blood shown on his hands. A man is killed by a few shots to the chest (bloody). His friends pursue the attacker and shoot back. A man shoots another man as retaliation for decorating the bar with a body (a large bloody bullet wound is briefly seen as he flies backwards from the force of the blast). A man morosely describes his past killings, sometimes in graphic detail. Various people drink whiskey throughout the film. William stops in a saloon where he ends up getting drunk. Two scenes where a man brutally beats another in a self-righteous and sadistic manner. They are both shown to be significantly injured afterwards. The attack on the prosititute may disturb some viewers. Some characters talk about it and add more gruesome, but untrue details to the story. A man is whipped and threatened by another man. We later hear this man died offscreen. A man hallucinates and speaks about seeing men he's killed with graphic detail. 8 uses of ""fuck"", 20 uses of ""shit"", 18 uses of ""bitch""/""son of a bitch"", 35 uses of ""damn""/""goddamn"", 40 uses of ""hell"", 3 uses of ""bastard"", 9 religious exclamations, and 10 uses of ""whore"". There is also a slur for Native Americans. There is also many slang terms for the human anatomy and coitus (""ass"", ""dick"", ""pussy"", ""pecker"", ""humping"")."

A husband watches his nude wife in the shower through a foggy glass shower door. Depending how advanced your tv clarity is which determines how clear the nudity will be. Scene lasts about 6-7 secconds. A man is wearing only his underwear in one scene. Cole's mother is briefly in a bra, with just cleavage visible.

At the funeral of a young girl, a videotape briefly shows a mother feeding her child poisoned soup to keep her sick. A man and woman drink wine and appear a little tipsy. Scenes where ghosts appear can be found disturbing, startling, upsetting, dark, and suspenseful. The behavior of the mentally troubled Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) is disturbing. A few genuine frights. Eerie atmosphere throughout. The scary bits are so well woven into the story that they are more thought provoking than frightening. A few jump scenes. Some of the entries under 'Violence & Gore' might be disturbing. Bullshit, ass and dick are used once each. Goddamn, damn and hell are used 2 times. Damn briefly seen scrawled on a piece of paper, however they are very easy to miss.

A realistic painting of a nude woman is seen. A patient makes very crass sexual comments about a woman whom he maimed, implying that she wanted to have sex with him and that she wanted to be naked. A man stabs another with a needle full of sedative, this isn't bloody but can be quite shocking When Teddy has a flashback to when he was at Dachau, the American soldiers line up the Nazi guards and open fire on the group. Some blood sprays but not overly graphic. The Nazis are shown being shot as they are riddled with bullets and an overhead shot shows the aftermath. Little onscreen violence, but the aftermaths of many violent acts are shown and they are sometimes quite gruesome. A man shoots another man twice in the chest. Blood sprays onto the wall behind, but it is quite unrealistic, and is very brief. A man looks at paintings of people and various torture devices. In one scene, a man is walking down a Nazi camp as he sees woman and children on the ground covered in blood. Very disturbing. A man commits suicide, his body is later shown with blood all around it and one cheek is mangled from the bullet entering his face. This is the most graphic scene in the movie.I A man face is very bruised and cut up from an offscreen beating. A man jumps out at a person and strangles him, but he grabs him and punches him in the face, until somebody stops him. A man is a recovering alcoholic A man is seen taking pills with a shot of liquor to cure a migraine. People are seen being offered and are seen drinking alcoholic drinks. Several men smoke cigarettes, cigars, and pipes in almost every scene. The entire film is filled with disturbing, unnerving and scary images. Corpses of holocaust victims are shown spilling out of railroad cars. Bloody, dead bodies of children are shown up close. The main character has visions and dreams that become nightmarish.

A man says a woman's got ""huge tracts of land"", an innuendo referring to her breasts, but also referring to the fact that her father owns the biggest tracts of open land in the country. A knight has both his arms and legs chopped off. Lots of obviously fake blood. Played for laughs. Nearly all violence is exaggerated and played for laughs. All scenes of bloodshed are so unrealistic and fake-looking they are unlikely to disturb. Two knights sword fight. The fight ends when one knight throws a sword (which goes through the other knight's head). Blood briefly sprays. Two men sword fight. Eventually, one man cuts off the other man's limbs one by one, drawing much blood. He is left on the floor without any limbs. Lasts about two minutes. A man is crushed by a huge wooden rabbit. Somebody is stabbed, there is lots of blood. Three men are stabbed, little detail. Somebody gets shot in the chest with an arrow. Lancelot slays multiple people at a wedding, and some people's clothes become blood-stained. His sword is also blood-stained. A child jumps out of a window in the tallest tower of a castle on a swamp. In a humorous scene, a seemingly harmless rabbit bites several peoples' heads off; causing blood to splatter everywhere. A knight (Brother Maynard) is eaten by an animated monster (The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrghh). A man suffers from a heart attack. Very brief. Some drinking The opening credits contains a sequence where the background rapidly flashes green and orange. This sequence may affect people with photosensitive conditions, but it only lasts for around 10-15 seconds, and is accompanied by Latin music - after the music ends, the flashing colours are gone and the movie is safe to watch. Keep in mind that this film was made in the 70s before the creation of the PG-13 rating and there are two noteworthy scenes of gore that could grant this an R. But considering the fact that the detail is so minimalistic and intentionally fake-looking and comical (as mentioned above), teenagers would be able to handle it and the film could pass for a PG-13 if made today, although young children may be disturbed by these scenes. A scene with gory fights between two knights, but the gore is unrealistic and PG-rated. If this came out today, it would only be rated PG-13 for language and sexual themes. The killer rabbit is a little scary but really, it it played as funny. Battles are more comical than intense. British people are more likely to take offense to the language with words such as ""bastard"", ""bint"", ""bloody"", ""pansy"", ""sod"", ""tart"", and ""tit"". There's also 2 uses of ""shit"" and 1 use of ""bitch"" and ""pussy""."

He screams in agony and we see his pained face. A live bull is lowered into a raptor pen by a harness and viciously devoured by the creatures (offscreen). When the harness is pulled back out, some diluted blood is visible for a few seconds. The bloody leg of a goat is seen after the animal is presumably eaten by a T-Rex. A T-Rex knocks a man unconscious, and we see him with a bloody leg injury.(Flesh and Bone are seen) A T-Rex dispatches a small dinosaur, and begins eating it. some flesh is shown dangling from its mouth. A Velociraptor tackles a man and we see it biting his face briefly. We hear the man screaming in pain offscreen and it is implied he is killed brutally by it. Most of the event is covered by plant foliage. Intense. A battle between velociraptors and a T-Rex ensues. The raptors bite it but the T-Rex proceeds to kill them both. A man smokes constantly throughout the film. Other characters drink occasionally. Alcohol is shown and occasionally consumed. There is quite a jumpy bit when Ellie gets attacked by the velociraptors. It is only scary the first time you see it, as it is unexpected. The second half of the film is comparatively intense and contains several sequences in which many of the main characters are in danger - mainly from dinosaurs in the park. A scene where the T-Rex escapes from the habitat includes one onscreen death and an unseen major leg injury. Children are in danger in the scene but come to no major harm.

Sexual Reference(s). No Nudity: only a man, who is in his white underwear . A young (teenage) girl asks if an older man wants to 'screw' her. Men describe the act of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. Some vulgar slang and sexual references. No nudity or act shown. The movie is about a woman whose child is killed (not shown) and her revenge. There is an animated segment where multiple people are killed. These are done in gruesome ways such as people's body parts exploding and blood spraying. Even though it happens in animation its still violent. The bride rips out a man's eye with her fingers. Graphic, but quick and it's in black and white There is a very bloody fight scene but it is very unrealistic. But still graphic and brutal. The bride fights a 17 year old. In that scene, she takes a floorboard and stabs the girl in the foot and then her head. Her eyes bleed. This is somewhat brutal. The aftermath of a bloody massacre/fight is seen, we see multiple dead bodies with blood and missing limbs. Graphic A woman stabs a man in the stomach. Extremely bloody A woman decapitates a man onscreen. The severed head is shown and a geyser of blood sprays out from the neck. This is graphic. The woman then holds the man's severed head in closeup for many seconds. The Bride kills a woman by throwing a knife into her chest. She then pulls it out and wipes the blood off. This isnt that graphic and only a small amount of blood is shown, but it's still pretty disturbing considering the fact that the woman's young daughter was standing right there when it happened. Before the major fight, the Bride kills other guys in a bloody and graphic fashion with her swords. The Bride kills a man by slamming two doors to crush his head. The impact isnt shown but the sound of his head cracking is heard. The Bride bites on a mans tounge and pulls on it. We hear a ripping sound and then see him lying unconscious on the ground covered in blood. While bloody, it is very stylized, unrealistic, and almost cartoonish. However it is still very graphic A woman's arm gets lopped off. She writhes in pain and there's a huge fountain of blood coming out of the stump, which gets everywhere including the camera Extremely brutal violence throughout, although most of it is darkly comedic. Defintely one of the most violent movies of all time In the biggest fight scene, numerous bad guys are hacked up left and right. Although, this sequence is in black and white it is still extremely bloody and graphic and the amount of blood that sprays is outlandish. The main character orders a bottle of sake. A minor is seen drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. Scenes can be found of background characters drinking alcohol and smoking. Contains scenes of alcohol consumption and brief smoking Characters are infrequently seen smoking and drinking. A 17-year-old girl is seen drinking heavily from a bottle in a bar. She slams it down aside scattered empty glasses. The only thing that could potentially disturb viewers is the amount of violence. Not a scary movie There is a lot of graphic violence and brutal kills. R18+ ( Strong Stylised Violence ) The anime segment of the movie is quite intense. The depiction of the murder of a married couple is violent and shocking. Similarly, it seems to have seriously psychologically damaged the daughter. ""Bitch"" is said at least 5 times. One use of ""trash"" in Japanese when a japanese girl uses the word for Ferrari. 16 uses of ""fuck"", 2 uses of ""cunt"", 1 use of ""cocksucker"", and other milder terms like ""bitch"", ""shit"", ""ass"", ""hell"" and ""damn""."

A husband and wife are talking on the couch as they watch television, and the man says, ""keep running your mouth like that and i'll take you in the back and screw ya."" He says it as a joke. Almost no nudity in the entire movie. Only one scene where a man is without shirt. He is wearing trousers though. A man is nude in a bathtub, but only his upper body is visible because of his seating position and the camera angles used. This movie contains some intense, highly frightening sequences of violence, in which there are implied deaths and injuries. However, all of this happens very fast but is sitil shocking. These scenes contain blood although rarely any gore. Near the beginning, a man is strangled by another man with handcuffs, resulting in the man's throat slitting and blood squirting. A man is unexpectedly shot in the neck, with lots of blood splattering onto a window, and lots of blood pouring out of the wound, then in the head. Blood also splatters onto a man sitting next to him. A violent crime scene is shown twice. Dead corpses are seen with blood all over them and flies swarming them, the interior of a truck has a dead body inside it with lots of blood on the seats. Two dead dogs are seen with bloody bullet wounds in them. A man is shot in the chest with a shotgun while sitting in a chair, blood pools on the floor around him. A man is shot in the face with a shot gun, we see the bloody bullet wounds in his face and we hear him choking to death on his own blood, we see a little bit of blood squirt out of his neck, it is implied that the perpetrator kills the witness. A man begging for mercy is shot behind a shower curtain, we see blood spray onto the curtain from the killers perspective. A man is killed on screen with a cattle gun, after this blood is seen pouring out of the wound Anton makes his victims call sides of a count to determine if he will kill them or not, He is very Cold and remorseless through the Entire Film. A man is shot in the head with a pistol. A man is seen dead from a gunshot to the head. There's blood on the wound as well as the broken glass the bullet exited through. A man is shot in the shoulder. We later see him removing shrapnel from the wound. A dog is shot with a pistol. The dog whimpers and falls down, dying offscreen. Two men are shot with a pistol. One man is shot in the chest and the other is shot in the head. We can see both bloody bullet wounds. A man's forearm is messily blown off with a shotgun, and dangles by a flap of skin. He then is shot with blood spraying. A man is shot in the chest with a shotgun, and is thrown back by the blast, many bullet holes visible. The floor then pools with blood. A desk clerk is shot offscreen. An empty chair where he was previously sitting is empty making it clear he is dead behind the desk he was sitting at. A man is wounded in the leg with a shotgun. He later dresses his wounds, pulling the buck shot out of bloody holes in his leg. The main theme of the film has to do with stolen drug money. In one scene you see many bags of heroin in the back of a truck. Infrequent smoking and drinking. In one scene a man is shown self medicating by injecting himself with morphine, though this is done to dull the pain of a gunshot wound. Anton Chigurh is an utterly remorseless and unrelentingly evil mass murderer. He's an incredibly vicious and disturbing psychopath who takes lives simply for the sake of killing, and he follows a murderous and nihilistic moral code that revolves around the concept of fate and chance. The depiction of his ruthless sociopathy is extremely realistic and frightening, and every scene involving him is unfathomably scary and nerve-wracking. The tone of this film is very dark and disturbing. The character Anton Chigurh will frighten viewers whenever he is on screen. Additionally, the movie has almost no soundtrack and it makes the film even more unsettling. The violence in this film is also realistic and tends to occur suddenly. The lack of audible score adds to the uneasy and tense atmosphere throughout the more intense moments. The goriest scene is towards the end where a man is shot we see blood quickly spray and then the scene cuts to later we see the man who was with him with his shirt with blood on it Moderately disturbing, we see people shot with blood spray A man is shown with blood on his shirt after being with a man who was shot Anton Chigurh is a terrifying villain and Javier Bardem's performance makes him all the more harrowing. The movie centers around a nihilistic psychopath who kills almost everyone he encounters, deciding some of their fates with a coin toss as he pursues a disturbed Vietnam War veteran with a suitcase full of money coming from a drug deal gone awry. Every single encounter with this character is extremely intense, frightening and nerve-wracking.

A barracuda with very long and pointed teeth snaps viciously at Marlin and Coral, Marlin is knocked unconscious, and the other fish along with many eggs are gone when he comes around (the barracuda apparently ate them although we do not see it). Dory is hit in the nose, her nose bleeds, Bruce gets a whiff of the blood and goes into a frenzy chasing Marlin and Dory through a wrecked submarine, crashing into doors, lunging through hatches, breaking through the hull and trying to squeeze into a torpedo tube; the two fish push a torpedo into his mouth, he spits it out, and it floats toward an underwater mine field setting it off. Two fish swim into very deep and very dark water, they see a light and begin to follow it, but it turns out to be a anglerfish with very sharp teeth, and it chases them and snaps at them (one fish ends up in its stomach, along with its lighted lantern, briefly). Two fish are surrounded by jelly fish (one is stung a couple of times), they bounce off the tops and try to get out but one is trapped; the other returns to save it and they both fall unconscious after being stung several times (one has scars on its side). There are tense moments when Nemo goes into a tank filter to clog it with a pebble and is sucked back into the filter tube toward a fan -- it is pulled out just before hitting it. Two fish are sucked into a blue whale's mouth and one rams repeatedly at its ""teeth"" (actually baleen plates used to filter krill and plankton) trying to get out. Eventually, water rushes through, the two trapped fish cling to the whale's tongue, and they are shot out of its blowhole. A large fishing net scoops many fish into it, they scream and panic, but then they swim hard downward and the net breaks and the fish are freed -- one fish seems injured but it's fine. A father fish panics when his son swims into open water, a diver rises behind the young fish and scoops him into a net. The father fish chases in terror but is pushed away by a boat propeller. A girl screams when a pelican flies through a dentist's office and a fish jumps into her hair. Two fish flop onto a table and one is flipped down a drain (we see him swirling through pipes). A man's mouth is drilled by a dentist (he yells and the drill whines). A dentist pulls a tooth out of a man's mouth when he is startled and the man yells. Two fish flap around on a pier surrounded by seagulls, and one is picked up and pulled on by the seagulls. A pelican scoops the two fish up and flies off, is chased by many seagulls, they swoop and fly and end up slamming into a boat's sails (their beaks poke through). A large shark smiles and laughs menacingly at two fish showing his many rows of pointed teeth, he escorts them to a meeting with two other sharks and the fish are frightened that they will be eaten. A frightened fish swims erratically in a tank and runs into the glass a few times, and a pelican flies into a window a few times. Two crabs snap at fish as it passes, a fish threatens a crab by holding it out of the water where seagulls can see it as a potential meal. A young fish goes through initiation rites in an aquarium and swims through a fast-flowing stream of bubbles that they call ""ring of fire."" A scary looking anglerfish chases Marlin and Dory and tries to eat them up. If you stay during the end credits, there is a scene where a small nervous fish eats the anglerfish up. Three sharks comprise a support group to stop eating fish, which is clearly inspired by Alcoholics Anonymous. Bruce's appearance has his teeth and how massive he is. After a heated argument where Marlin's overprotectiveness becomes too much for Nemo to bear, Nemo swims off to prove him wrong and gets captured. There's plenty of lighthearted humour, and it's themes has struggling with parenthood and being separated from one's father. The whole film can be very distressing. A pelican flies into an office. A girl screams at the pelican. The pelican knocks down one of the tools and it goes on. Nemo's capture will frighten younger viewers. Dory and Marlin get chased by a anglerfish with strobe patterns and very sharp teeth the sounds it make are very unsettling and frightening for younger viewers. Moderate Scary Scenes and JUST PERIL PERIL PERIL!!! The sight of a huge shark (Bruce) with a mouthful of sharp and nasty-looking teeth. We then learn that he's going through a step program to help him not eat fish, but when he spots some blood, he sets out after Dory and Marlin (through an old sub and open water) and repeatedly bites at them and slams into various things while trying to get them. They end up in an old sub's torpedo chute with Bruce repeatedly banging into the opening, forcing a torpedo (and them) closer to his mouthful of teeth. Marlin and Dory are being chased in the abyss with the Anglerfish, although it has some comedic relief in it. A fish almost gets caught in a tank filter. A character says 'Don't you people realise we are swimming in our own...', but gets shushed before he can finish the sentence."

There is no sex or nudity in this film. Reference is made to underwear which have been soiled with blood. A man in his underpants runs down the hallway. (no nudity) When the research crew is in the Norwegian base, they find the frozen corpse of a man with his wrists and throat slit, implying the man committed suicide. The burnt corpse of a man is found. It is completely black with ashes. It is implied that he torched himself before the thing could assimilate him. When the characters transform, the gore is very highly detailed with a lot of blood and tearing of flesh. The characters faces have deformation of features, eyes bulging, skin splitting etc. When the thing transforms, it is always gory and scary. The research crew uncovers a dead thing. It has an incredibly gruesome design, with two faces melted together, and it is covered in blood and slime. A character is killed by a gunshot. Minimal blood is shown. One of the characters transforms into the thing offscreen. It pops out of the floor as a huge monster with the character's face on its head, and one of the dogs from the kennel (now hairless and covered in slime) comes out of its stomach. An autopsy is performed on a dead thing. They take out its organs, and examine them in detail. While not gruesome, the scene is very gross. A husky transforms into a monster. It is seen as a writhing blob with limbs and a dog head, before red tentacles emerge from its body, as well as claws that grip to the ceiling. The thing kills various dogs in a kennel in a variety of gross ways, but it is pretty brief. When the thing is attacking the dogs in the kennel, a man shoots one of them to make its death quick and painless. Very little blood. The thing (disguised as a man) has gasoline poured on him and is set on fire. A brief fistfight ensues. A man gets his arms bitten off by the thing. It comes out of nowhere, and is shown onscreen. Gory, but very brief. Several men have their thumbs cut and the blood put into dishes for testing. The cutting shown and there is very a large amount of blood that oozes out. This happens twice. Some people may be grossed out by this. A man reveals itself as the thing. Its hands extend into claws, his head inflates and stretches, and eventually the head splits open and turns into a giant sharp toothed mouth. The thing latches its mouth onto a man and thrashes him around. He is eventually thrown into a shelf, where we see his bloodied body onscreen briefly. A man is shot square in the forehead. Seen from a distance. An alien is blown up onscreen with a grenade. No blood. Bloody, shredded clothes are seen. Several characters drink beer and whiskey, but it is not graphic or explicit. One character smokes marijuana. A brief heroin joke. Several people have morphine injected into them. During a blackout, theres a jump scare where an alien runs past a man making mysterious sounds A man is infected and walks out into the snow, falling to his knees. The research team gathers around him and he lets out a creepy/eerie scream and has a rather eerie look on his face. The creature of the title has no defined form. What it looks like, or what it even IS, can't actually be described. Paranoia is the main theme, as no one knows who is human or alien. Several jump-scares that come out of nowhere. Huskies in a kennel are assimilated and devoured by the thing, and one dog is shot to avoid a more painful death. Some animal lovers may find this scene upsetting. The aliens are disturbing to look at. They are basically a mixed up pile of body parts with a head and tentacles. They also have rows of sharp teeth. Each alien is differently designed. In one scene an imitation has gasoline poured on it and it is lit on fire, the imitation lets out a roar that is very disturbing and will unsettle many audiences. There is a scene were a man suddenly transforms into an alien and rips another mans arms off. This is an extremely successful jump-scare, as nothing like this happened for 45 minutes.

None, except for a few kisses. There are one or two scenes that show John Merrick without clothes, albeit in silhouette. In a surreal sequence a woman is knocked over by an elephants trunk and seems to be in pain. A scene where a man is being operated on by surgeons, we see his body for a few seconds. We can see blood on his whole face and torso and his chest is open, though it's not very gorey because it's in black and white. A scene of two women fighting, they are yelling and being held back by people in a crowed and police officers, their faces are covered in blood. A man grabs another man by the throat. A man threatens another man with a metal rod and is then hit on the head with a heavy object and knocked out. A man hits a young boy and he falls over. A man bumps into a young girl while he is running and she falls over. A man is beaten with a cane in multiple scenes. A few scenes where characters are seen smoking. Scenes of drinking and a scene with a drunken mob. Throughout the film, John Merrick is continuously tormented by society, and he's shown getting physically and emotionally abused. This is extremely emotionally upsetting, depressing and traumatizing, especially for anyone who has gone through a similar fate. The main character has an extremely deformed appearance that many could find disturbing. However, the film makes a point of showing how he is a very good and gentle man despite his affliction. In a traumatic dream scene, Merrick is kicked with a drowning noise in the background. 1 Damn 5 uses of 'B*sterd'

The woman gets up and we could see her side breast for a couple seconds (partial breast nudity is shown in the scene). However, the nudity is brief and doesn't last long. A man and woman start to kiss passionately; moments later they are seen lying in bed naked, sex is heavily implied. We could briefly see a dead man's frontal nudity in a hospital morgue; a brief glimpse of lower nudity is visible in the scene. Photographs of a man and woman having sex. No specific nudity. They are clothed except for their thighs/side buttocks. A man's buttocks are briefly shown as he puts on pants. A woman references incest in one scene, nothing is explicitly described. A man makes a sexual joke in one scene (the word ""screw"" is used repeatedly) A statue of a naked woman is seen. Though, the statue is made of dark wood, so its hard to notice any details. Not the center of the attention. Some sexual discussion occurs in the film, usually in the form of jokes and references. Two murdered bodies are discovered at two different times in the film(1 man and 1 woman). A man's nose is slit, blood is shown, but he quickly covers it. Some fistfights, including characters being beaten up and thrown against walls. Characters are punched repeatedly in the fistfight scenes. A woman is slapped many times. A woman has a black eye implying that her husband struck her. A man is shot in the arm and slightly injured. Several instances of cigarette smoking by characters, as accurate for the time period. Smoking throughout entire movie. A couple scenes of social drinking. The film as a whole has a dark premise, as it centers on themes of corruption and also our powerlessness against evil. These dark themes play an important part in the plot of the film, and are even subtly stated through dialogue. The entire movie is fairly intense. Many characters are threatened. There are two murders, both of which could be intense to some viewers. Other swear words include ""goddamn"" ""hell"" and ""asshole"", used a couple times each. ""Screw"" is used several times in one scene, as a sexual joke. ""Chinaman"" is used in one scene. Some strong language is used in the film. Only one use of ""fuck"" a few race related language such as ""chinaman"" but other than that, it's milder (""Damn"", ""hell"", ""ass"" and ""shit"")."

The camera focuses on her closely as she kisses him and his body. The man then stops her and pours cold water down his underwear to calm himself down. This scene lasts over 4 minutes, but no nudity is seen other than the man's bare chest. A married man and a teenage girl begin kissing in a bedroom and it is implied they go to the bed and have sex, but this is not shown. Frequent and quite explicit conversations regarding sex throughout. There's no nudity or actual sex shown though. A man is paranoid that his wife is sleeping with other men. A fight breaks out in the crowd of a boxing match with punches thrown, a woman is trampled, and a man's body is tossed in the air. The film is shot in black and white so the blood and damage is far less realistic than it otherwise would've been. We briefly see a man cleaning another man's bloody mouth after a fight. Blood is shown but it is easy to miss. Jake La Motta has numerous boxing matches; punches are thrown however there is little to moderate blood in most. However this is not always the case. In a boxing match, a fighter beats another against the ropes; we see heavy swelling and some blood on his face. Blood and sweat also splatter over the judges. In another, a boxer violently beats his opponent. It's mostly bloodless. A character wraps a piece of cloth around his knuckles and hits another character in the face multiple times. The man being punched asked to be. Some blood is seen on his face. An advertisement for beer on tv is played. The main character buys a club and spends time there. Many people drink and smoke. The main character smokes cigars very often in the latter part of the the film. A woman smokes a cigarette. The boxing matches are hyper-stylized, and often yield bloody results. The main character has violent tendencies and a self-destructive nature. Quite a few heated arguments between a man and his wife. The film is filled with extremely intense scenes of verbal and physical violence. The scenes of violence will be uncomfortable and intense for sensitive viewers. Rated R for strong language, violent content and brief sexuality. The main character has violent tendencies and a self-destructive nature. Quite a few heated arguments between a man and his wife. ""C*ck"" is said once in a vulgar manner. 114 uses of ""f*ck"". ""C*nt"" is said three or four times ""Faggot"" and ""fag"" are said 5 times. ""Queer"" is once. ""Piss"" is said once.

It is implied that Rhett is a customer of the brothel, and a good ""friend,"" i.e. customer of madam and/or prostitutes. A woman strips naked and she quickly covers herself up; we see a glimpse of what is actually a covered side of one breast. References to adultery. Two cousins marry. Though considered taboo now, it wasn't during the Civil War. A woman is in love with a married man, and offers to have his children, though he refuses. People sometimes kiss passionately, including scenes where a woman kisses a married man. There is a scene in which a woman says that she is willing to ""sell herself"" for money if needed. A man threatens to rape a woman, but it's nothing direct. Husband picks up his wife and carries her upstairs, implying marital rape, although she is seen waking up in bed the next morning in a happy mood. Some other mild sexual references. A woman says, that a man shot a horse and that she thought, that he wants to shoot himself. Some war violence and mild blood. War is a constant theme of the movie. Lots of scenes of the wounded, where hundreds of men lie dying, some with amputated limbs, and all with some blood (though not that graphic). One scene where a soldier has his leg amputated (off screen, but shadows show the amputation occurring), we hear him screaming and yelling in pain, and a woman watching in disgust. Cannons bombard a city, reducing it to rubble and ruins. A soldier threatens to rape a woman, and she shoots him point blank in the face. There is quite a lot of blood splatter. A city gets a report of fatalities at the most recent battle. Characters are slapped or punched. A woman is in pain when she is in labor. Buildings are set on fire. A man falls from a horse, breaking his neck and dying. A child falls from a horse and breaks her neck. A horse in obvious distress is beaten with a whip. A man is drunk multiple times. A man gets drunk and acts and talks relatively aggressive. A young woman drinks in secret. Men smoke cigars. A woman falls off stairs after she tried to hit a man. Discussion of war and disturbing images of wounded soldiers and lists of the dead being disturbed. There is a scene in which a woman comes along her dead mother's body, screaming. There are several scenes in which a woman tries to escape soldiers and is severely frightened. A man and woman escape a huge fire with a baby, a slave and an ill woman in the back of a carriage. A very young girl falls from a horse and breaks her neck. A woman dies in bed. A woman shoots a man in the face, then drags his bleeding body away. Hell is used to refer to the place several times, and Clark Gable also says at one point ""damn Yankees"". One use of ""damn"" in the classic line ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" (It was shocking at the time it was originally released.)"

Scantily clad women in performing clothing early on in the film in the BTN tower Natalie Portman wears a very short skirt and rolls across a bed and her underwear can be seen There is a photo seen of a woman's buttocks You can see the outline of a womans nipples through her shirt (30 seconds) A man is hanged. His body is shown writhing in the air. One man kills multiple others with knives in quick succession in several scenes. Lots of blood is shown. The violence is very infrequent, the movie is more of a drama than an action movie. Most of the violence happens at the end. A man goes on a murdering spree and slashes, stabs and throws knives at multiple men. Very bloody but it looks very fake and unrealistic A young woman is stopped in an alley by three men who intend to rape her. A man is knocked to the floor and police place a bag over his face. Two men get beaten with punches, kicks and throws while their attacker is holding a knife. A group of 'undesirables' are shown in dirty glass boxes, being tortured and used for biomedical warfare testing. A man is burned beyond recognition in a fire. An open grave with heaps of naked dead bodies is shown. A young girl is shot and killed onscreen. A man is hit in the jaw with a gun. His face is shown a moment later to be covered in blood.

A man drinks whiskey while his taking his pills. Two detectives smoke cigarettes. A man smokes a pipe, another smokes a cigar. Legal and illegal drugs are shown in a medicine cabinet. Homosexuals, lesbians and minorities are shown being detained and tortured inside state-sponsored concentration camps. The scene in which Evey receives letters from a lesbian inmate may be emotional and upsetting to some viewers, especially if they, too, are empathetic people. The film has a cold and ruthless dystopian setting akin to George Orwell's novel 1984, where the United Kingdom is ruled by a brutal white supremacist, Nordicist and neo-fascist totalitarian dictatorship that has taken control of the land. The main villain is a ruthless dictator and a complete psychopath who brutally murders his opponents, and this may all be upsetting for some. The film also has a brutal and grim atmosphere. The ending is very emotional. It also leaves the viewer with a grim reminder that governments should not be trusted too much. Occasional Holocaustic imagery. Mass graves, torture, human testing, etc. A man threatens to have a woman killed by firing squad. A woman is arrested and tortured for information. A man is shot multiple times, later removing his armor to reveal his bloody chest. He bleeds to death in another character's arms, this is emotional and may upset viewers.

Her bare behind is seen briefly. a man and a woman share a kiss A button on the new console is labelled 'puberty'. Joy says that it's probably not important. Anger ends up punching and choking Fear. Anger ends up shoving Fear & Disgust (twice). Fear is often on the receiving end of cartoon violence, often from Anger.  The Haunted Mansion music plays in Riley's first nightmare. Played for laughs. A zombified rat is in Riley's dream. A giant clown is featured as one of Riley's greatest fears. A dog is briefly seen apparently cut by half during a nightmare sequence; the head end then chases the tail end. Riley's teeth fall out in a dream sequence and in another one a zombified rat appears in reference to a dead rat she finds in her house earlier. A running gag about all the curse words that Anger knows. He never actually says any. After Joy and Sadness disappear, Anger asks if he can 'say that curse word now'. heck is used twice Anger nearly says a curse word, but Fear bleeps it out, albeit accidentally. Disgust deliberately insults Anger so she can use him as a welding torch when he bursts into flame on losing his temper.

Some sexual jokes. A discussion about ""arse intruding"" dildos takes place. There is a scene where there are dildos in an office. During a scene where a a man is talking to two other men, a naked stripper is seen in the background and out of focus. A character tells another character a story about how a character killed one of his subordinates with a dildo (named by the character as, ""a 10-inch rubber cock.""). (The scene cuts between the guy who's telling the story, and the guy beating the other guy with said dildo. Not graphic.) A woman use a loaded machine gun to shoot a man and fill a room full of bullets. She is slapped by another man right after. A man kills another man with a thrown hatchet. The violence, although graphic, is predominantly comedic in tone, played for ironic, over-the-top humor. A massive gun battle takes place just offscreen. There is a lot of loud gunfire, and a witness gets a little blood splattered on his face. In two scenes, we see the aftermath, and there are many dead and extremely bloody bodies all over the room. Two men are shot and killed (blood splatters), another has a hatchet thrown into his back, and a fourth man is then shot. Several men are shot with an air gun, but not seriously hurt. Another man is passed out on the floor in front of them, and his toes are blown off (offscreen, but we see the bloody results a few times, as well as the man screaming in agony). A man is sliced across the shoulder with a machete. He survives, but is very bloody. The same man is then shot to death with large machine gun by a woman shortly thereafter. A man hits golf balls off another man's face, and hits a man who is tied up, gagged, and hanging upside down. The torturer then throws a large knife into the hanging man (not seen), and supposedly kills him (we see the torturer's mates look on in disgust as this happens). A man runs out of a pub, and is on fire and screaming. We later see that a man spit liquor onto him and threw a match to light him on fire. A man kills a man by repeatedly smashing his head with a car door (offscreen). A man tortures a man and woman by putting pieces of paper between their toes and setting them on fire. A man is shown torturing another by repeatedly dunking his head in water. A man is tortured by having a tanning bed repeatedly slammed down on him; he is knocked out (off screen), and presumably left in the bed. Three of the main characters are marijuana dealers, so several scenes take place in an apartment where they are growing weed and smoking it. Eddie's dad, JD, owns the local bar where the boys hangout, so there are several scenes involving alcohol and them getting drunk/smoking. The plot revolves around weed. Harry is seen getting ready to snort a pile of cocaine, although he never actually does on-screen. A lot of swearing, blood and gore. Not suited for minors. Constant threats, beatings, etc. While intense, the film is very lighthearted. 2 uses of ""cunt"". Many uses of the slang term ""bollocks"". Men swap jokes which are obviously offensive, though the punchlines are not heard. 130 uses of ""fuck"". Some British swear words of varying intensity, such as ""wanker"", ""bugger"", ""arse"", ""twat"" and ""sod"". Other frequent mild language such as ""shit"". Three derogatory terms for homosexuals."

This is shown very clearly. The breasts on a dead girl are shown a handful of moments or so (sometimes close, sometimes distant) as well as once in her pubic region from a distance. A rape scene (please see the Violence/Gore category for more details) shows the bare back of a man as he kneels over a woman in a bed, he pulls his pants down below bare buttocks, rips away the woman's tank top to reveal her breasts and abdomen, and we see thrusting motions, as the woman groans and cries; later we see the crime scene where the woman is shown badly scraped over her entire body and she is almost entirely nude (we see her lying on her back with her genital area covered with a sheet corner, and her panties down around one ankle). A man and a woman embrace lightly twice and kiss very briefly once. A female court officer states that vaginal penetration in a rape case was very deep. Throughout the film, instances of unrequited love are mentioned in conversations: loveless marriages, high school crushes, a man widowed early in marriage and never remarrying, and an older court counselor in love with a younger, married female court supervisor; one male character states several times that no one can abandon his or her passion. A comment is made about a high school boy that seems to look at a high school girl often and with passion in his eyes, as if he is in love with her. A courthouse employee dispatches unwanted business calls by answering the phone falsely as ""Sperm Bank; do you want to make a deposit or a withdrawal?"" A man searches another man's room and finds magazine photos of bare-chested men. We see the back of a man at a urinal in a men's room (he is clothed), in one toilet stall; we see an older man with his trousers down (he has long white shorts and bare knees). In a rape scene (please see the Sex/Nudity category for more details), a man rips away a woman's top and rapes her: her face is bloody, forehead to chin, and in a flashback we see the man pick her up in his arms and drive her head into a wall (we see no marks or blood); we later see the crime scene, where the woman is shown badly scraped over her entire body and she lies on her back and her face is bloody. Several black and white photographs of a rape and murder victim's face are seen throughout the film -- about 5 times. A man asleep in a living room armchair at night wakes to loud knocking at the door, three men enter, the man goes into the bedroom, sits on the bed and we see one of the other men shoot at the bed with an automatic rifle several times, pause, and fire one last time: we later see the man on the bed dead, a gaping wound in his forehead and several in his chest, with dried blood covering his face, chest and right arm. A man strikes another man in the face with a crowbar (we see no damage but this is shown twice), forces the second man into a car with him, and drives to an isolated area by a railroad track, stands outside the car and when a train comes, walks to the car trunk, opens it, and fires a gun into what appears to be the body a man (shown 3 times). A suspect is chased through crowded soccer stands, he hides in a men's restroom, jumps out at one man who was chasing him, slams him back against a wall, runs away, police join the chase, he jumps over a wall, injuring his leg, stumbles onto the field, is struck by a running player, falls (he has a bloody face), and is surrounded by barking dogs and police carrying nightsticks. Two men are found in a dark and dirty jail cell, sitting on the floor: their faces, arms and wrists are covered in blood, welts and bruises from having confessions beaten out of them, and another man shouts and runs toward the warden and is restrained by guards. A man in an elevator with two another man and a woman pulls out a handgun with a flourish, loads a magazine, and places the gun into the waistband of his trousers as the woman trembles and the other man seems angry. A man is nipped on the ankle by a small dog, off camera, and we hear the dog yelp and see it fly across a door opening, as if it had been kicked. Two police officers struggle with a man, pulling him out of a room; there's unintelligible shouting after the shoving of a man had occurred. We hear several cases involving murder, rape, and assault being discussed over a courthouse phone. Several arguments with name-calling occur in different scenes; one argument in a restaurant ends with police escorting one man away. A courthouse employee dispatches unwanted business phone calls by answering the phone falsely as ""Morgue."" A man confesses to killing another man. There are at least 9 scenes of cigarette smoking. Seven restaurant and bar scenes show drinks being poured and 4 or 5 men drinking (one man states that it is his passion to come there and drink and sometimes argue with friends.) We see 4 black and white photos of people toasting with drinks at a wedding. A judge accuses a law clerk of purchasing a bottle of whiskey and drinking from the bottle while leaving the store. A man smokes cigarettes in a couple of bar scenes, in the mezzanine of a courthouse and on the street. There are many intense scenes throughout. There is one reference to c*cksucking while name calling. About 28 'f' words (and its derivatives). At least 10 occurences of ""Christ,"" ""Jesus,"" and ""God"" (collectively). 17 scatological references, 9 anatomical references, and 19 mild obscenities. Name-calling (moron, nuts, old lady, crazy, insane, idiot, imbecile, retard, dimwit, stupid, silly, angel, chump, stuck up, incompetent, untouchable, party pooper, Twinkie, Amazon, Pygmy, prostitute, drunk, schmuck, zero, Napoleon Solo, Mike Hammer, Perry Mason, Fascist, Nazi), 23 stereotypical references to Africans, women, Argentines, judges, homosexuals, the rich, the poor, college graduates, senior citizens,"

Contains scenes of infrequent mild violence and scary scenes. An elderly woman is seen smoking in some scenes. A room that is lit begins to become dark, and is bordered with what looks like dark shadows of spirits. A young man is seen melting from his human form into a pile of green slime. In an illusion, a room is suddenly filled with water. The characters are then seen floating in a sky, and tiny blue human-like spirits (with no faces) hold hands and dance around the characters. Then, one of the human characters is seen being transformed into a bird, not of his will, and slightly agonizes over the transformation. He then leaps up grabbing the other characters with him and breaks out of a window. A ship is seen with flames coming out, and is presumed to have been shot down. Men jump into the harbor to escape the flames. Then, in the harbor, a few bombs fall out of the sky into the water. People run in a panic, but nobody is seen harmed. A few scenes are shown where a creature with a human head fights off creatures who're flying. Towns are seen on fire. There's one scene of missiles hitting the ground and destroying a house. Contains religious swearing in the English version. Mild language. In the English version, there is a single usage of ""ship"", but if one doesn't listen closely, it might sound like the word is ""S**t"". In the original Japanese version, one use of ""damn"" is present."

There is a calendar in the Japanese commander's hut with an American lady on it. As the months progress her clothes get more inappropriate.She is wearing a bikini in one image A small boy in a tribal village is seen naked from the waist down, his penis is barely visible. But this scene is not explicit in any way. No sex or adult nudity; the closest the film comes to this is bare-chested men. Two men try to escape, both are shot and they die. A character is slapped and characters are mistreated and tortured by Japanese soldiers. Some mild scenes of fistfights and arguments shown. Some mild war violence. Blood is visible several times throughout the movie, most notably when a man is wounded in the foot and after some men are killed in the river. The Japanese colonel is implied to commit suicide if the bridge isn't completed on time. Two characters share a drink in a couple scenes. Relatively intense throughout. Early in the film, a few characters attempt to escape the prison camp at night time but are shot and killed, one falls off a ledge and another is wounded but survives. The climax is intense. The ending can be tragic to some. None.

Man and women kiss, she implies she enjoyed having sex with him earlier(no sex scenes or nudity in the movie, only dialogue) A man and woman have intercourse off-screen. This movie is quite violent but the main issue is the depressing thematic material throughout. A woman kicks two high schoolers (one boy, one girl) hard in their crotches. A man throws an IV of blood against a wall resulting in a small bloody splash. A man suffering from cancer coughs some small spots of blood onto a woman's face by accident. We briefly see photos of a severely burned corpse of a murder victim. Graphic references to sexual assault. A police officer beats up a man with a pistol and tosses him out of a window while some woman in the building is screaming in anger. The police officer punches the screaming woman in the face. The film contains some verbal references to illegal drug possession. Drinking and smoking regularly throughout the film. Someone asks Mildred if she has done drunk driving; she says, ""Maybe once."" This film is very heavy. It revolves around a woman who lost her daughter to a rapist and it is mentioned that she was burned alive. She then decides to put up Billboards that say the police aren't doing their jobs, which drives the whole town into anger, and hatred. Other dark elements are explored such as a man dying of cancer, suffering from the loss of a child, rape, domestic abuse, depression, on screen depiction of suicide and violence. A woman drills a tiny hole through a man's nail in self-defense. The film has many moments that are played for dark humor, but are still intense. Non-stop swearing throughout. 100 uses of ""fuck""; a few of the uses are sexual. 2 uses of ""cock""; both are used in a sexual manner. 4 uses of ""cunt"". Use of homophobic and racial slurs. A few uses of ""shit"", ""bitch"", ""retard"", and ""asshole"" are present as well."

A man and a woman have sex on TV for about 5 seconds. Most of the graphic sexual content takes place in one extended montage of multiple couples having sex. A scene shows a short montage of different people having sex, during this you see full frontal female nudity and male nudity, but it isn't prolonged. One of the only scenes of sexual content. There is a fleeting glimpse of Kelly Macdonald's dark pubic hair. This occurs as she is seen putting her dress back on after sex. Kelly's hairy triangle is seen literally for a fraction of a second. Begbie is shown destroying a hotel room in a fit of rage. No one is seen being hurt. Despite being somewhat infrequent, the violence 'Trainspotting' does have is very strong. Very bloody depiction of a woman screaming having a beer glass thrown on her head(outcome shown on her face).Palms slashed and people being hit by Begbie during his outbursts(bloody results). A bar fight occurs In which numerous punches are thrown but this is brief. A man is cut in the hand by a knife, we briefly see the wound. This is very bloody. Renton and Dianne smoke hashish in Renton's flat The film is about drug addiction. Characters are shown drunk or getting high because of drugs. There are frequent depictions of the characters preparing drugs, including scenes of them heating the drugs over a flame, tying their arms with belts and injecting the drug into their veins. While such scenes are frequent, the film does not promote or glamourise drug abuse. There are a few drug induced hallucinations in the film as well. All characters smoke and drink and several scenes take place in bars. A character shoves a Morphine suppository up his anus and accidentally defecates it into the toilet and has to retrieve it by going into the toilet, which leads to an oddly fantastical sequence in the toilet waters. Trainspotting has many disgusting and uncomfortable scenes even though it is a dark comedy. Renton experiences bizarre hallucinations during heroin withdrawal, including a baby rotating her head 180 degrees as she crawls across the ceiling. Many consider this to be one of the scariest non-horror movie scenes. The violence is brief, but it can be shocking. The treatment of a transvestite may be off-putting. Renton inserts a Morphine suppository into his rectum to help with the withdrawal symptoms while he is trying to detox from heroin. However severe diarrhea is a common symptom of opiate withdrawal and he accidently defecates the suppository into a filthy toilet that is already full of feces. He then proceeds to reach into the toilet and starts feeling around trying to find the suppository among all the feces. He is then seen pulling himself into the toilet and swimming around. (the latter half is a hallucination) Pervasive language 142 uses of ""F-word"". 23 uses of ""c*nt"". Pervasive use of ""sh*t"", and ""piss""."

One man offers another a bottle of alcohol, but is declined. A man drinks liquor from a bottle in front of a recovering alcoholic. All of the MMA fight scenes are extremely brutal, especially the final fight. The movie has an overall dark and emotional tone.

Very brief. A sex scene is shown for about 6 seconds, in which both characters are fully nude, but the camera is mostly on the mans backside. A few non-graphic and very brief sexual remarks and said. Two men and two women have sex in the same motel room. The scene only lasts about 10 seconds. A fully nude man is thrown over the couch (genitalia and buttocks are shown.) Though much of the violence occurs offscreen, it is still often shocking and sudden. Most of the victims are innocent. Almost all of the violence is through shootings some of them are even oddly funny due do the unrealistic amounts of blood that come out. A couple are killed after witnessing the cop shooting. After crashing their car, the man is shot in the back while trying to run away (no blood is shown). The woman is then shot offscreen while pinned in the car. While having sex, a man is attacked violently. He is kicked on the floor, and then whipped and strangled with a belt. During this attack, a man is slammed against a wall to the point of unconsciousness, and a woman is kicked in the back. A man is shot in the back of the leg while running from the cops, with a little blood on the wound. Some random characters are seen drinking in pubs/bars. One of the kidnappers smokes many cigarettes. Many intense scenes. One involves a home invasion and kidnapping. Some intense scenes include police search of suspicious criminals, a brief car chase, running from peril, shootings, and dangerous encounters. The two thugs may frighten viewers, especially one who is heavily implied to be a psychopath; he rarely talks and does almost all the killing with relative pleasure and no hesitation. Although there is a good amount offbeat comedy with the exaggerated Minnesotan accents and some situations the characters get into, the violence is played seriously and never meant to be funny. Rated MA15+ ( Strong Violence, Coarse Language & A Sex Scene ) The wood chipper scene is the most graphic in the movie. Almost all uses of 'fuck' are said by Steve Buscemi's character. 73 uses of ""fuck"", 5 uses of ""goddamn"", 7 uses of ""shit"", 14 uses of ""Damn"", 2 uses of ""son of a bitch"", 1 use of ""Hell"", 4 uses of ""ass"" (3 used with hole)."

Very brief and not too noticeable. A beaten and bruised woman is shown. It is later said she was raped. The act is never shown, though and neither is any nudity. Nothing super graphic, but there is gang related violence periodically A character trips over and blood is seen on the floor. A man occasionally coughs up blood due to illness. A man is burned in the cheek with a lit cigarette by a gang of thugs. A gang drive-by shooting riddles a house and one character is wounded in the neck. A man is dragged out of his house and he is kicked and punched. You can see bruises and he is bleeding. He is then held up at gunpoint. Most of the violence occurs offscreen and when we do see it, it is dark and most of the visuals can be missed. Walt drinks beer on occasions and is offered rice liquor from the Hmong family A man drinks a lot of beer. Alcoholic drinks are shown consumed at social gatherings and a bar. Walt's granddaughter who is about 18 is smoking. A man smokes on screen a few times. It is inferred that he has developed lung cancer as a result of his constant habit. He is seen coughing up blood a few times. Neighbours attempt to slaughter live chicken, not shown but implied chicken was killed. The film can be intense throughout due to the fear that violence will erupt or characters may be hurt in stand-off, gang-related scenes. The scene on the lawn is quite intense. Several scenes of characters pointing guns at each other as well as some scenes of shootings. Slurs for African Americans, Italians, Polish, Hispanics, Jews, Indians, Asians and homosexuals are heard throughout the movie. 80 uses of ""fuck"". 23 uses of ""bitch"", 1 use of ""bastard"", 30 uses of ""ass"", 22 uses of ""hell"", 10 uses of ""damn"", 7 uses of ""pussy."""

She is clearly frightened. He forces her to kiss him. Although the music of the scene frames it as romantic, it is clearly without her consent and is assault. Brief nudity in all versions of the film. After a replicant (working as a stripper) finishes showering, she dries her body and dresses, and both of her breasts are fully visible. (This is only in the director's and final cut.) In one scene, Rachael's left nipple is seen through her transparent bra. (This is for the Director's Cut.) There are some minor sexual themes but no nudity in any kind, nudity is included in the directors cut on two brief instances though. Two girls are shown dancing in underwear , but just for a few seconds Brief breast nudity shown in the final and directors cut, no explicit nudity elsewhere. Some women are shown in semi revealing clothing. A woman straddles a man's neck in a fight and attempts to choke him with her thighs. She spins his head around and slaps it multiple times but then lets him go. A man has his eyes poked out by an android. This is not very graphic, unless you're watching the Final Cut, in which case it is very graphic. In the Final Cut, we see the act and we see the gory aftermath. In the other cuts we just see the act, no gore. A Woman is Shot in the Shoulder Blade and falls into Broken Glass. Not a lot of violence, but the violence that Blade Runner does have can be bloody and intense. A man is shot twice in the chest; he flies backwards in the chair he was sitting in. No blood is seen, but in the Workprint version you can see smoke or steam coming out of an exit wound for a few seconds afterwards. A man is shot through the back of the head and you can see (from the front) his forehead burst open. Surprisingly little blood is visible. A man's skull is crushed (not visibly, but a crack is heard) and we see blood come from his eyes as the perpetrator's thumbs are pressed into his eye sockets while the victim groans in agony (very disturbing). The Final Cut, International Cut, and Workprint versions show this on-screen with blood pouring from the eyes of the man being killed. This isn't as graphic as one might imagine due to much of the blood being obscured from the perpetrator's thumbs. The other versions, U.S. Theatrical Cut and Director's Cut, cut away until the attacker lets go. A woman is shot in the chest. As she writhes on the ground, she is shot again until she dies. Bloody bullet wounds are very briefly visible, including one shot where blood pours out of the wound. Much of this scene is shot from a far distance. In the Final Cut, International Cut, and Workprint versions a woman briefly lifts a man lying on the ground a bit by hooking his nostrils with her fingers. A man grabs another man's hand and breaks a couple of his fingers. You can hear the fingers breaking and see the man wince in pain. He later resets his own fingers and you see them bent back at first. A man has the tip of his ear shot off at close range, with the wound and blood quite visible. A man hits another man in the face with a metal pipe. You can later see blood on the man's face. A man intentionally stabs a nail through his own hand. In the Final Cut, International Cut, and Workprint this is seen clearly with a little bit of blood. The actual stabbing is done very quickly and the shot of it going through is brief. The other versions, U.S. Theatrical Cut and Director's Cut, cut away from this until the nail has already gone through. Characters are seen smoking cigarettes and drinking alcoholic beverages in some scenes. The movie overall can be very emotional and depressing, as it deals with themes of existentialism and what it means to be human. The scene where an android pokes out a man's eyeballs is very intense and may disturb some viewers. This is arguably the most violent scene in the movie (despite not being extremely graphic). A character is seen hanging off a building by his fingers. The film is very dark and depressing, and there is a growing sense of paranoia throughout. The final confrontation between the main character and antagonist is very intense and frightening. The ending is emotional and intense. 1 use of ""Christ."" 1 use of hell, goddamn, and asshole. In the theatrical version the n-word slur is used once in the voice over. ""Fucker"" is heard. In the Final Cut, this has been replaced by ""father."" A few other, milder profanities such as ""asshole"" or ""goddamn."""

A man is hit on the back with a wooden club-pan multiple times bloodlessly. A woman's face/eye is scratched, possibly with a razor. Difficult to tell which, as it's brief and seen from a distance.

A man is frequently seen drunken, which fuels his abuse and torment of the slaves Several characters drink casually throughout the film. A man says he has been fired once for having alcohol problems. The main character is wrongly enslaved and in constant danger throughout most of the film. The whipping, beating, and face-damage scenes could all be hard to watch. The rape may upset some viewers.

A man sprays water on a naked man where his back and is upper part of his buttocks is shown. The frame last for only a couple of seconds. A painting of two nude women kissing while holding each other's breasts and rubbing each other's genitals is shown. Breasts, nipples, and thick pubic hair are clearly seen. Their actual genitalia is also somewhat visible. Not overly graphic due to the painting's somewhat abstract nature. However the nudity is pretty clear and it is pretty evident what the women are doing. The painting is shown in multiple scenes. A scene with black and white pin up photos of women in the background. Breasts and nipples are seen on all of them and some of them show the women's pubic hair. The photos are in the background of the scene, and relatively small, but they are in focus and pretty easy to see. All nudity in the film is shown in brief glimpses. It is only breast nudity, with most of them in a non-sexual context. The sexual content in the film are not graphic and are also brief, including fellatio and post-coitus. There are non graphic black-and-white paintings of naked women in the background of some shots. There are naked statues. A man says a woman is like dynamite in the sack Some remarks about a man being a predator Brief shot of man and a woman kissing in bed. A prisoner fatally stabs four prison guards and is himself killed in the struggle. The fight is kept offscreen, but the aftermath is shown, with various bloodstains on the bodies. Many people get punched, often leading to bloody noses and bruises. A cat is thrown out of a window. The cat is seen spread-eagle on the pavement in a bright red splat of blood. We see a bloody bag with the dead cat in it later on. The effect is cartoon-like rather than gory. A shootout between many characters ensues; no one is hurt and the scene is meant to be humorous. Most violence and gore is comical rather than horrific. A woman's severed head is pulled out of a basket. People socially consume alcohol. A man is seen smoking. A cat gets thrown out a window All violence is portrayed in a comedic tone (the movie is not dark) Probably the most profanity of Wes Anderson's movies. Most profanity is used in anger Homophobic slurs like ""faggot"" ""candy ass"" and ""fruit"" are used about twice each by one character ""Fuck"" is used sexually a number of times. 17 uses of ""fuck"" A few uses of ""shit"", ""ass"", ""damn"", and ""hell"". 2 uses of ""faggot"" Name-calling and several stereotypical references to ethnic groups."

No gore is seen however the deer can be seen collapsing and struggling to breathe as it dies. Alcoholic drinking is especially prominent in social situations including parties. People drink alcohol frequently. Lots of smoking. Includes intense scenes of brutal war violence and torture. The subject matter is pretty depressing, as the film deals with the psychological effects of war and doesn't shy away from showing the audience the realities of war. This film may depress some viewers as a result of its realistic subject matter. The film, as a whole, is very intense, particularly enhanced by its gritty realism. Many scenes from it may trigger PTSD for such veterans.

A man is disturbed and knocked out of his bath, but all private parts are covered by soapy water. A husband and his wife give each other a morning kiss Several brawls which include sight of mild violence and use of weaponry. Some slapstick. A woman slices open a fish. Its innards can clearly be seen. Drugs: None Smoking: None The town is initially a rather dark and, even, scary place. The residents are in the middle of a fight between two clans. The fights are cartoonish and no actual violence can be seen. Sight of knives, spears and other weapons. An implied dead body is seen being carried twice. Klaus initially seems threatening. The protagonist fears for his life (eg. worrying about being sliced into little pieces and thinking he is holding a severed head). Some scenes that are quite dark in nature but have a comedic overtone and will probably go over children's head, for example 2 people are seen carrying a bag in the shape of a body and a shoe falls out of it, suggesting that someone is inside the bag (this happens twice) God as blasphemy The words ""loser"" ""brat"" ""stupid"" and ""idiot"" are all mentioned throughout the film."

His butt is seen for several seconds but no frontal shots. One of the soldier is proud of his physique and works out nude, brief glimpses of his backside are shown. A couple references are made by the other men about his anatomy. The Sargent then proceeds to force him to train nude as well until he has completed the training that day A soldier is reading a magazine about women. We see the cover of the magazine, which depicts a topless woman, however we do not see her breasts. This is very brief, only a second or two. The battle scenes are very graphic, realistic, and absolutely spine chilling to watch. They are long, and filled with bloody gunfire, graphic stabbings with knives and bayonets, and lots of gruesome explosions which separate limbs and leave blood everywhere. It has tons of guts, limbs, intestines, and tons of blood everywhere. In the very first Hacksaw scene at Okinawa, one of the soldiers is shown with his legs blown off. Bloody strings of fat and muscle are shown protruding from his legs as he is dragged to safely. His femur and tibia bones are shown for several seconds The kickstart of the very first Okinawa battle scene, one of the soldiers is slowly crawling through the war-torn battlefield. Suddenly, a wounded soldier rises from the rubble and starts screaming in terror in front of the soldier. A gunshot is heard and the screaming soldier takes a bullet to the back of the head, splattering brain matter all over the face of the soldier. Then they are both ripped apart with bullets. Very graphic, not for most viewers. Probably the most violent the movie gets The main character is very close to a grenade explosion and is flung backwards. His legs and thighs are shown bloodied and burned. Not too intense. Not exactly a spoiler as this is briefly shown in the very beginning of the film In the beginning there are soldiers being burned alive by flamethrowers and in the midst of explosions and others being shot during the combat of war A boy hits another boy in the head with a brick while they are fighting A man has his leg crushed by a car which gives him compound fracture and causes blood to spurt out of his leg A man smashes a glass bottle on a tombstone as a result his hand bleeds on the tombstone from his wound A man throws a knife into another man's foot A man punches a man in the face in order to instigate a fight and test him A group of men beat up a man which results with the man bloody and bruised Soldiers being riddled with bullets through torsos, legs, and heads with blood spurting out. Explosions from grenades, mortars, and RPGs that cause some lost of limbs and tissue damage. Soldiers being stabbed/bayoneted and beaten up with fists. Soldiers are burned alive with flame throwers and exploded by them as well. Some soldiers are decapitated and commit suicide with self stabbing and kamikaze attacks. There are soldiers dead on the ground with intestines strewn out and missing limbs on the ground which also on some bodies have rotting flesh with maggots and rats feeding off of the bodies Body parts are shown being blown off throughout each battle scene. A man is seen drinking whiskey from a bottle during the day. He is later described as being an alcoholic. Some soldiers smoke cigarettes. (Realistic) There is a fistfight between two brothers, which takes a dark turn when one of the brothers smashes the other over the head with a brick. The brother is immediately knocked out, and it is implied that he might be dead. There is a scene where a father is beating his wife and threatening her with a gun. His son comes in, takes the gun from him and points it at his father. This scene could prove to be disturbing to some viewers. This movie is more violent than saving private ryan The movie portrays the horrors of war as it is, and does so realistically. There is a jump scare when two opposing soldiers are frightened upon contact and shooting occurs.

A woman's nipples are discernible through her shirt in several shots. A woman is dressed but braless, and without a bra, the shapes of her breasts are noticeable. A young boy is seen frequently in his underwear. In one scene his mother removes his wet underwear. No nudity is shown. There is no male or actual female nudity. Male captor comes into Room at regular intervals, rips and rapes his female captive. This is seen through the viewpoint of her boy in the wardrobe peeking through the slats. We only see captor removing his jeans, in his underwear, nothing more. Occasional moans from 'Old Nick' (her rapist and captor) are heard. In the scene Ma makes Jack pretends that he is sick, she sticks her fingers down her own throat and we see vomit on Jack's pillow. A boy sees a woman lying on a bathroom floor unconscious from an apparent suicide attempt. Sexual violence is heavily implied but never shown on screen. In one scene, Old Nick chokes Joy after she tries to protect Jack from him. There are bruises seen on her neck the next morning.  The premise of the film itself is highly disturbing, with a woman being forced to raise a child in a confined space after being kidnapped. Ma is raped on a regular basis, and she hides Jack in a wardrobe whenever Old Nick visits so that he does not have to see what he does to her. When Jack leaves the wardrobe and wakes up Old Nick, Ma panics and attempts to shield Jack from him, Old Nick responds by choking her and threatening to murder her. 10 uses of ""fuck"" 4 uses of 'God' and 3 uses of 'Jesus'"

They are scantily clad throughout the movie. Some large women are seen hooked up to milking machines. Their breasts are briefly seen but not their nipples. In a long shot, a nude woman crouches on top of an old electrical tower, wailing and when she stands we see full side and back nudity (in profile), then a brief glimpse of full nudity as she slides down a rope. Very brief and not meant to be sexualizing. There are several instances of gun violence. A woman wounds a man with a double-crossbow, sending a long dart right below the man's eye and through to the back of his head and another bolt into his chest with some blood flow; the wounded man jumps off a tall vehicle and slams two spears into another vehicle, which explodes and presumably kills him. We briefly see a chainsaw cut into a man, with some blood spraying. People get ran over by huge cars countless times throughout A brutal brawl breaks out between three main characters, they are pistol whipped and tackled to the ground. A war boy is pistol whipped in the face with blood spurts. The violence is almost completely bloodless until the last 30 minutes, where blood and gore become much more frequent. A man is shot from a far distance. We later see that both of his eyes got shot. Blood is all over his wounds. Very violent bloody gory Though actual gore is kept to a minimum, there are frequent scenes of violence and very long vehicular chase scenes. These include scenes where people fight or are shot. However, injury detail is very limited. Many people are shot but it cuts before the actual gore is seen. But sometimes it is seen. Several of the mechanics/war boys spray their faces with spray paint and you can see they are affected by this like a drug. Similar to huffing. A good half of this film are intense car chases, this isn't even exaggerated The film features numerous intense, crazy car chases that host scarred, disfigured, and unnatural individuals. The dark, twisted themes of survival, preservation, and violence are lightened by the presence of slight comic relief and over-the-top action. The movie is half action and half thriller, most of the villains look disfigured and therefore creepy. The film is very intense because it is basically one long car chase and will keep its viewers on the edge of their seats. At least one use of fuck but all strong language is said over loud crashes and explosions, making them very hard to hear. A couple of uses of bollocks and schlanger

He then states that the helmet he is wearing was made in the same fashion and that the two helmets are a matching set, implying that the helmets had been the two cups of the breastplate. Two brief kiss scenes A large dragon eats another small dragon (a Gronkle). This accounts for one of the three deaths in the entire film, the other main one being the Red Death itself/herself when Hiccup and Toothless take it/her down into an explosion. A third, minor death (one Zippleback) occurs shortly after the Gronkle's death, in the same way the Gronkle died. When Hiccup attempts to demonstrate how his bolas cannon works to Gobber, it malfunctions. Gobber dodges it and the item the cannon shot out flies through the window and hits another Viking outside. The first time Astrid says ""That's for x, and that's for y,"" she knocks Hiccup to the ground and thumps the butt of her axe on Hiccup, presumably on his stomach. Astrid has a running gag of punching Hiccup in the shoulder before negating it with a corrolary nice thing to say. A sheep is killed in the beginning There are several action sequences involving warriors in combat with dragons, mostly dodging the dragons' attacks. Some mild violence with crude weapons which mostly end up hitting inanimate objects. No blood ever shown. One character talks about his dragon conquests which cost him body parts. He has a false foot and a hook for a hand. Dragon violence involving breathing fire. Viking drink from large mugs in celebration, implying beer or ale. The movie starts with dragons attacking a village at night. Dark scene with fire and explosions. Fighting with/defending against large dragons in an enclosed arena. The Night Fury roars at Hiccup, while Hiccup looks away. This is unexpected and this is mostly like a jump scare. Toothless brings Hiccup and Astrid to the dragons cave, inside there is a big hole where the dragons are dropping food in it, a gigantic dragon jumps out of it and eats one of them, this could be scary to some kids. Towards the climax of the movie, Stoick says that ""all hell is gonna break loose""."

It's a doodle and not flesh and is mild. A scene where characters watch a few seconds of an adult film on a small screen. One woman is in very revealing clothing, and one of them is fully nude (you see her breasts for like half a minute, then 2 characters make out.) A woman bounces on a trampoline. Breasts are briefly shown and it is in the background and it's blink and you'll miss it. A woman is forward in a meeting with the ""Dude"" discussing sex and making a reference to the male anatomy (penis). A woman is hoisted on a harness whilst creating a painting. She is then seen shirtless from a distance for a bit. A woman in a bikini asks a man to blow on her toes to dry nail polish, she then says she will give him a blow job for $1,000. No sex or nudity. There is a brief discussion about a character who is a registered sex offender and the time he did in prison. According to Walter, said character exposed himself to an eight-year-old and was forced to inform everyone in his neighborhood before moving in. One of the main characters works at a porn studio, so there are some scenes that take place there. A scene in which she arrives there shows her topless from far away, but breasts are still briefly visible There are several close up scenes of a topless woman sitting crossed-legged as she floats upward off the screen. All nudity in the film is for comedic purpose and is not really to be sexual or provocative. Multiple instances of brief breast nudity and sexual humor, but other than that fairly clean No pervasive scenes of nudity, only a few female topless scenes---which are all notably brief. Other than that there is some mild themes of sex, as well as brief conversations and dialogue revolving around the topic. Never graphic but explicit at times. Some crude humor A man in a dream looks up a bunch of women's skirts ( nothing shown ) A nude woman runs past a window in a backyard. No detail can be seen. The violence is played for humor, but some instances are intense. A severed toe wrapped in gauze is sent in the mail. There is some blood on the bandage as it is unwrapped. Thugs come into The Dude's home and smash his belongings with a cricket bat. Walter uses a crowbar to destroy a Corvette. The owner of the Corvette later uses the crowbar to destroy The Dude's car. A police officer throws a coffee cup at The Dude's forehead and pushes him to the floor. A thug interrogates The Dude by shoving his head into a toilet. Another thug urinates on The Dude's carpet. A man gets hit in the stomach by a bowling ball; he almost vomits and appears to be in pain. The Dude is shown smoking marijuana a couple of times and he is constantly high. The Dude drinks ""White Russians"" in several scenes. In one scene, The Dude drinks beer and smokes marijuana while driving, causing an accident. Characters smoke cigarettes. The instances of people breaking into the Dude's home an assaulting him may be difficult for some viewers. Overall the film is a comedy and even the tense moments are meant to be took jokingly.

There is NO Sex or Nudity in this movie A woman hits Randall several times with a shovel because his son thinks that he is another gator who got in the house. Many fight scenes.  Boo is restrained and the scream extractor is moving forward to her as she screams until Sulley saves her. At the beginning of the movie (after the opening credits), a monster slowly stands up beside a bed with a kid sleeping on it, and the score gets pretty scary. The boy turns and sits up and screams, but the monster immediately screams louder and slips on a soccer ball/football and some jacks. In other words, what looks like is the scene about to turn pretty scary actually ends up being funny. Mike is restrained and the scream extractor to confess were Boo is at, and as the extractor is moving forward to him as he screams until Sulley disconnects the extractor. And when it's connected again by Randall, the one who is screaming in the extractor is Fungus. Sully does a really big, scary growl for a demonstration and frightens Boo who runs away in tears (we see images of his face later, with teeth and claws bared).

It is at night, but the silhouette of her bare breast is briefly seen. Her butt is seen. A woman asks a man if he wants to get drunk and fool around, implying sex. A man sings a rhyme 'For fifteen years she kept her virginity, not a bad record for this vicinity'. During the ""No whistles"" scene, if you look very closely you can see the lifeguard's crotch through his shorts. Quint says "" Here's to swimming with bow-legged woman"". A man's severed head appears in the hull of a sunken boat. One of his eye sockets is empty. Quite gruesome. A teenage girl's hand, missing one finger, turns up on the beach. There is no blood. A man is dragged out of a rowboat by a shark. He is partially seen in its mouth as it bites down. This is somewhat obscured by the bubbles and water. His bloody severed leg is then seen sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Plenty of blood clouds the water. A man investigates a corpse. He gives a graphic description of how she was killed by the shark. Brody shoots at the shark. Many bloody bullet holes are seen in the shark as blood trails in the water. A man looks at pictures of shark victims that have chunks of flesh missing. The skin is healed up around the wounds in one picture, but it is still rather gruesome. One of the characters ignores advice to have the wine breathe a little, and fills an entire tumbler with wine. He is later shown slightly under the influence. A group of teenagers pass around a marijuana joint and drink while on a beach. People are shown drinking. People are shown smoking. Three men sit around in a boat drinking and begin to appear drunk. Some scenes with the shark are disturbing. This movie is highly known to have made many people stay out of the water during its original release. The PG rating this film has is very outdated (it was even questionable during its initial release). The movie has a lot of blood, disturbing images, scary scenes, and a bit of nudity. If made today, it would get an R. There are several scenes of surprising fright - for example, a diver is examining a damaged boat and while looking into an underwater hole in the hull, a severed head appears. The scenes with the shark are usually very intense and disturbing. A man's dog goes missing, as he is playing with him on a crowded beach that is being monitored by beach patrol for a possible shark in the area.

No Nudity. A scene of heavy kissing. There are some pinups when Rocky breaks open a locker, quite brief and no nudity but scantily clad Rocky's girlfriend tries to ""fool around"" with him but he refuses, nothing happens Rocky passionately kisses Adrian a few times. Adrian resists Rocky's kisses at first which may come off as uncomfortable. She liked Rocky back but was extremely shy; he didn't try to force her into anything. Paulie comments On Rocky's relationship with Adrian crudely and asks him if he's sleeping with her and ""screwing"" her Rocky is in a boxing match at the start. It is short but there is just normal boxing and a head butt. Some bruises and minor cuts. Rocky's boxing match with Apollo Creed is quite long, many punches are thrown, Rocky's nose is broken, many bruises are shown on his face especially his eyes and he is knocked down many times. Apollo Creed is shown with many bruises and cuts as well. The dialog tells us that Rocky intends to punch Creed in the body and mentioned breaking ribs as a possibility to hamper Creed's breathing, and then in the fight, we learn that Rocky did break one of Creed's ribs and we see Creed listing slightly to one side. Rocky wants his eye to be cut due to heavy swelling from Apollo Creed's attack. Benny cuts him with a razor, blood runs down his face. Some may feel the scenes in the meat locker to be ""gore"". The half-carcasses of cattle hang throughout (""sides of beef""), and Rocky angrily punches one. Then gets the idea of using them for training. He uses them in a supplement to punching bags, and gets his fists all bloody. He mentions that he is able to break the ribs in the sides of beef. Various characters are seen smoking cigarettes, including Rocky himself. One of the main characters is an alcoholic, he is seen drinking from bottles, being drunk and acting erratically throughout the film. A 12 year old girl is smoking a cigarette, but Rocky takes it away from her and tells her it's bad for her People are shown drinking in a bar. Another in which Adrian says she can't leave the house because she is cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving, and Paulie responds by taking the turkey out of the oven and throwing it out into the alley. Another scene in which Adrian shouts at Paulie about his emotional abuse, about how he made her feel like a loser. A scene when Paulie gets drunk and breaks stuff with the baseball bat. Rocky and Apollo Creed's boxing match is unsettling. The heavy bruising and both of them and the punches may cause people to flinch. Especially when Rocky's eyelids have to be cut, the brief spurt of blood may cause any to look away. Some emotional moments. Around 5 uses of ""whore"". Godd*mn is used 5 times one time being hard to hear 3 uses of a-s, 1 son of a b--ch, 1 bastard. freaking loser, freaking moron are used.

They gang up on her and before anything is about to happen, another American soldier comes and pulls them off of her. We see a poster of a partially naked woman near a man's bed. A man is shown with a sculpture of a naked woman. This is easy to miss and it is not so obvious. It is implied that some of the villagers were raped by Americans in the massacre. Not seen. No sex scenes in this movie. Plenty of sexual banter. Overall this is a very violent movie, not just graphic violence but graphic in tone as well. American soldiers eventually start fighting each other, due to their frustration. One soldier grabs a knife and attempts to kill another soldier, but his men tells him to calm down. An American soldier's corpse is seen pinned to a tree with a moderate amount of blood visible. An American soldier holds a gun to a Vietnamese girl's head in front of her family, but another soldier punches him in the face and the two fight until a third soldier breaks them up. Both bleed. A man is blinded by shrapnel and covers his face screaming before a Vietnamese soldier comes up and unloads a gun on him. A man is wounded by an explosion nearby, another man cuts into him with a knife to rip the shrapnel out. Two men are blown to pieces after an airstrike is called on them. A man is shot in the lungs and has trouble breathing while oozing blood. It is implied that a man is piecing his internals back in. Scene isn't graphic. A man runs away and another man shoots him from a distance, killing him. A brief scene of taking wounded men back to an Aid zone, though it is a short scene there are many sitings of wounded men, dead mutilated bodies, and medic is covered in blood. An unarmed Vietnamese woman is shot in the head at close range as her husband and daughter look on in horror; we see blood spray from the wound, very graphic. A Vietnamese soldier is taunted before having his head bashed in with a rifle butt. This is implied and offscreen and quite unrealistic as only quiet thuds heard. Some blood sprays onto the perpetrator's face, but this is not graphic. The whole scene is intense, disturbing, and horrifying however. One soldier loses a hand when another soldier accidentally throws a grenade in his direction (some blood is shown). Two men are in a Vietnamese bunker when it explodes, and one emerges with no arms. One soldier has his leg blown off by a booby trap (the injury is not shown). In one battle scene, a soldier runs away from his foxhole, but runs into a tree and is then bayoneted by a Vietnamese soldier. It is implied that a young Vietnamese girl was raped by American tropps. This is not seen however, although you do see a group of Americans soldiers crowded around laughing while she is crying. Cigarette smoking is pervasive throughout the entire film. Wounded men are given Morphine syrettes to ease their suffering. A soldier steals a case of beer. A soldier introduces another to Marijuana by passing him a Marijuana cigarette. A group of soldiers smoke Marijuana at their base camp. The methods of smoking are a pipe, a gas mask, a joint, and a Remington rifle. A group of soldiers drink beer, whiskey (referred to as ""Kentucky Windage""), and Southern Comfort during a poker game. Soldiers smoke Marijuana from a pipe in their barracks. A Sgt. is shown drinking straight out of a bottle of Jack Daniels. He is visibly intoxicated, and takes a hit from a Marijuana pipe. A soldier smokes a Marijuana joint in the jungle. A soldier takes a bag of heroin out of the clothing of a dead Vietnamese soldier and smiles happily. American troops murder and rape a village of old people and very young kids. They gangrape young children and torture the old folks. It is a long scene. After killing and raping, they decide to burn the village (along with all food and supplies) and leave. This film has a dark and graphic undertone, and most of the violence is realistic to things that have happened in Vietnam. A scene in which a Vietnamese villager is being tortured by soldiers, especially the conclusion, may be very disturbing to many viewers One theme of the film is that of some of the soldiers who have been there for as short as two weeks going insane with bloodlust and mental visions. The implied rape of a young Vietnamese girl is disturbing. The end is very depressing. 159 uses of 'f**k', and many uses of 'shit', 'ass', 'bitch', several uses of ""g**k"", and 1 use of the 'n' slur. Language is frequent in spurts rather than constant but it can be very aggressive."

Infrequent mild sexual references are made, mostly in a joking or humorous manner. No actual sex or nudity whatsoever in this film. Some very brief rude dialogue, but on the most part it is innocent After falling into a deep pond, the gang find leeches on their bodies. When taking them off, blood is seen. This may be disturbing. A dead body is seen. His eyes are open and he has some blood on his face. A young man has a word carved into his skin with a razor-blade, with blood seen. This is voluntary however, so there is no violence during the scene. An older boy bullies a younger boy by pushing him to the ground, getting on top of him, and putting a lit cigarette close to the his face. It then stops before anything happens. Teddy continuously punches Vern in the shoulder. Vern finally gets fed up and jumps on top of Teddy, pummeling him. The villain threatens several young boys with a knife but is stopped before anything can occur. The antagonist is threatened with a gun. We hear someone was killed with a stab to the throat. A boy dies in a car crash. We just hear about it Smoking is glorified Young boys are seen smoking cigarettes. Older teens drink and drive (as well as smoke) in several scenes. The film is about a group of boys looking for a dead body There are several threatening scenes between the boys and an older gang. An intense stand-off scene with characters threatening each other with a knife and gun. We see a funeral recession for a teen boy where the father blames his other son (this is all a dream). A man mocks a boy's mentally ill father and the boy tries to scale a fence to kill a man.

A punk is killed by getting punched through the chest (partially offscreen). The Terminator's bloody hand is seen, and it is holding the man's heart. The Terminator goes to a gun store to purchase weapons and upon receiving the goods, shoots the clerk. We only see the end of the gun as it fires; we do not see the clerk die.

Overall: Frequent, brutal and extremely graphic sequences of high impact action violence with significant blood and injury detail. People are stabbed and decapitated usually with quick but sometimes brutal results. The violence is fast-paced and thus quite hard to not notice. During the opening scene of the film, a gang member shoots Wolverine in the chest with a shotgun, and we see him on the ground with bloody wounds in his chest. As he tries to protect his car, he's shot in the shoulder. The gang members then beat him up and kick him. Wolverine kills them and slices a man's arm off (no blood). We then see their corpses on the ground covered in blood and wounds. This scene is very intense although not too graphic and not much blood or gore. Wolverine tries pulling out one of his claws, and we hear him groan in pain and his hand starts bleeding while we also see his knuckles covered in pus and blood. A woman's right arm is bloodied from a gunshot wound, she stitches it up. A dead woman is shown in a motel with a bullet in her chest, no blood is shown. In a video an empty hospital bed is covered in blood. A man watches a video of scientists performing surgery on a little kid, not much detail is shown. A girl with metal claws cuts herself repeatedly, blood comes out of her arms, a kid commits suicide by jumping off a building, we don't see him fall to the ground but still disturbing. A mutant uses his powers to light a man on fire, (not graphic or shown in detail). Sad and intense. A man is hit in the back of the head with a metal pipe, he then falls to the ground unconscious, later on he wakes up with his face bleeding after being kicked in the face. Three men attempt to capture a girl inside a warehouse, we hear gunshots and screams in pain, implying they are killed. A little girl is carrying a decapitated head, we see the stump, she rolls it on the ground creating a trail of blood. A little girl using her metal claws to kill armed soldiers with a small amount of blood splattering. A man shoots the girl with a harpoon and we see it go right through her, staining her shirt with blood. She then pulls it out of her with lots of blood coming out. Wolverine kills several soldiers by slashing them across the face and body (this mostly includes a small amount of blood). Laura stabs a soldier in the eyes behind a car window and we see lots of blood on the window. A heavily armored truck with people in it is then crushed by a freight train. A mutant's skin burns up and starts swelling and falling apart from being in the sunlight, we hear sizzling and see his horrifically burned face. Wolverine stabs three men frozen in time in the face and abdomen. Laura stabs a wounded soldier in the chest, a small amount of blood is thrown from his chest. Wolverine lies in a hospital bed with several bloody wounds in his chest and abdomen. An intense action sequence shows Wolverine and Laura kill several armed soldiers by stabbing and slashing them across the face, neck and chest in a forest, but this is all shown super quickly making it hard to see any blood and gore or injury detail. Wolverine is shot twice, with a little bit of blood spraying. He grabs a man from behind and uses his gun to shoot a soldier in the head, with bloody results but extremely quick. Wolverine is left standing with some bullet holes, still alive but covered in lots of blood. Several kids use their powers to kill a mercenary, we hear his neck snap and possibly some blood coming from his neck, but this is easy to miss. A kid uses her powers to impale a man with thousands of wood splinters, causing him to bleed as he groans in pain and is eventually torn apart into pieces, causing him to explode into pieces of gore and meat. This is very brief, but is shown mostly on-screen and is one of the more graphic parts in the movie. As said before, in one scene a girl gets a harpoon speared through her heart but survives, although with blood staining her sweatshirt. Very intense, fast-paced and fatal violence throughout. Though this film is very violent (enough to justify the R rating), a lot of the violence is quick. It should be noted that while this movie is violent, it is more of a fast-paced action movie and isn't a gorefest. The film is filled with intense and fast violence. On-screen body count: 76 but in the movie, the violence is very intense. Several extremely intense and chaotic battle sequences throughout. However, they're all fast-paced and there's not much detail because of that, but can still be a bit brutal. Logan and Laura's retractable metal claws are used to slash and kill their enemies. While most of the action is fast and some of it is implied, there are some images of bloody injuries and violence. A kid uses her powers to freeze a man's arm. We see lots of blood and dead tissue building up into a stump as the arm becomes increasingly gangrenous and necrotic until it turns into solid ice. Afterwards, the girl smashes the arm and it's shattered into pieces as the man screams in agony. Quick but kinda gory. Logan buys tobacco, but we do not see him smoking onscreen. Logan is seen drinking alcohol throughout the film. He is also seen injecting himself with a medical drug towards the end of the movie. Logan give medication to Professor X, as well as inject medicine into him, to end his seizures. The beginning of the film pretty much gives you a good idea of how violent the film is going to be, but as it goes on the violence escalates. The whole film is very bleak and depressing, and has the tone and look of a dystopian movie. There are incredibly intense scenes such as the warehouse fight, and some scenes have somewhat of a horror vibe to them. Wolverine is covered in blood in a lot of scenes. The forest battle is pretty brutal, with Wolverine running and clawing through various mercenaries as he is shown roaring angrily. The character that Boyd Holbrook plays is a mercenary who enjoys inflicting harm upon mutant children. This movie is intense but not that scary at all. However, it's very bleak. Overall the profanity isn't too frequent and the majority of it comes from Logan himself. 54 uses of ""fuck"", several uses of ""shit"" and ""asshole"", 4 uses of ""dick"" and 4 uses of ""damn"","

It is said that a man lost his job at the circus for ""fooling around with the ringmaster's daughter"". Linguini says that he has a ""tiny little..."" and then Colette's eyes go down to stare at his crotch briefly. A couple of passionate kiss scenes, nothing too extreme. A man considers stuffing a rat down his boxer shorts to hide it. His boxer shorts are briefly visible. A rat is exploring the kitchen and is trying to avoid the fire under the stove and getting put in the oven along with some type of food. He is okay after that. Any violence presented in the film is purely slapstick. Scenes of peril throughout. A woman with a shotgun shoots repeatedly at two rats, many holes are blown in the house and furniture, the ceiling collapses and a huge number of rats pours out; the rats scurry and run, the woman follows the rats and continues shooting at them, the rats sail away on small makeshift boats, and one rat is separated from the others. A woman aims a gun at a man, the man grabs the woman's arm, they struggle and the gun fires, but no one is struck. While hiding under a young man's shirt a rat scratches and bites him repeatedly; the man swats at it and thrashes around (we see red slash marks on his chest and abdomen later). A store window has a display with many rats whose heads are stuck in traps, and other rat killing items including poisons. A rat is trapped in a cage-like trap (it is not injured) and locked in the trunk of a car. Two men are bound and gagged and locked in a food pantry by rats. A pack of rats chases a man, clamber onto his car, and he tries to drive away but crashes. A man on a bicycle crashes into a parked car. A blindfolded young man uses a knife to cut and chop food and cooks while a rat controls his movements. The floor of a man's room is shaped like a coffin. A young man imagines a man telling him that he'd like to order his ""heart roasted on a spit."" We hear that a man died after receiving a bad review from a food critic. A man talks about having killed someone with his thumb, and a woman talks about several other men and their dangerous backgrounds (being in prison, and being mysterious). We hear explosions and see flashes of light coming from inside a house and a rat crashes through a window. A young man flips a crepe out an open window and we hear a traffic accident in the street below. A rat pulls a young man's hair to control his movements. A young man tastes a soup and vomits out of a window (we hear him gagging). A rat finds rat poison among the garbage that other rats are eating from, and stops them from eating any more. A man pours several glasses of wine for a young man, who drinks them, becomes drunk and later passes out, a man pours a glass of wine and drinks from it, a man drinks wine, people pour glasses of wine and toast (no one is shown drinking), and a man pours wine over a rat's head. In a scene, Linguini has a nightmare: when he takes the order of Anton Ego about what he wants to eat, he says that he want his heart roasted on a spit (doing this with a very feral look on his face, including deranged-looking eyes and a disturbing smile) before laughing creepily as Linguini watches in horror before it's all revealed to be just a nightmare. This scene can be very startling for younger viewers. Jumpscare at the beginning. 2 rats are struck by lightning and fall from the roof of a house. There is a near drowning scene while Remy is in the sewer. Various instruments for killing rats are shown. Dead rats are shown in a store window. Might be frightening for very young children. Skinner says ""Welcome to hell"". A person says: ""Thank God"", without religious context 1 anatomical term, a few references to rat ""patootie,"" 1 mild obscenity, name-calling (idiot, insane, fancy pants, stupid, dumb), and the use of heck (American/British profanity), but more referring to the place, 1 use of bloody (British profanity)."

We find out that due to substance abuse, one of the characters dies very young. Characters smoke cigarettes throughout the movie. The word ""tobacco"" is used several times and tobacco brands are displayed on advertising. A white powder, implied to be cocaine, is briefly seen. The film as a whole does not promote or encourage drug misuse. There are graphic recreations of crashes, and the aftermaths of crashes, which some viewers may find distressing.

While some may find the head spin freaky it is quite unrealistic and not graphic.

She has a very curvy body, thin waist, big thighs and a large bottom, and throughout the movie, multiple shots of it are shown, and she is seen wearing a very tight super suit, and black leather heels that showcases it. Mr. Incredible briefly pats Elastigirl's backside (comedic and playful manner), and she does the same. Elastigirl acts suggestive on Bob on top of a building. A long-term couple kisses several times, flirts, pinches each other on the bum, and acts passionately in love. Elastigirl thinks that Mr. Incredible is cheating on her, but he isn't. Teens have a crushes. Mirage's outfits highlight her cleavage. Elastigirl wears a skintight costume. Syndrome makes a racy comment: ""You married Elastigirl and got busy?"" In one shot, there is a newspaper headline that reads ""X-Ray Vision Peeping Tom?"" Slightly suggestive scene where a man leers at Elastigirl's bust while talking to her. As she walks away, he stares intentively at her plump backside. Mirage tends to speak in a flirtatious way. Syndrome catches the Incredibles and is surprised that Mr. Incredible married Elastigirl. He then looks at their kids and says ""And got busy!"" Mirage wears an outfit that reveals a bit of cleavage. Dash makes fun of Violet for being ""hungry"" for Tony Rydinger. Overall, lots of mild action, never too bad, can be a bit intense at times, punching, kicking, people getting severely injured. Dash is chased by men in jets who have guns. He punches a man and gets thrown by him. He is unharmed after this scene. Mr. Incredible grabs his boss by the neck and tossed him through 4 office building walls (literally). Mr. Huph survives. In the hospital, every part of his body in casts and bandaged up. Elastigirl punches Mirage in the face and berated her husband about his adultery. A man attempted suicide by jumping off a large building and sued Mr. Incredible for saving him mid-fall, the suicidal man didn't seem to mind the injury that Mr. Incredible accidentally gave to him. Multiple fight scenes in which people are hit, kicked or punched. A man is punched and loses several teeth, briefly and played comically. In a scene where Mr. Incredible talks to Edna Mode about a new supersuit, Mr. Incredible talks about having a cape but Edna shouts ""No capes!"" and lists many superheroes who lost their lives because of their cape (in the following order: Thunderhead, Stratogale, Metaman, Dynaguy and Splashdown, flashbacks show them getting snagged to a rocket, one getting sucked into a twister, ect. ). Despite the dark humor, this scene is obviously played for laughs. Several scenes in which multiple flying devices piloted by evil henchmen explode during a chase. A robot is shown attacking a city, hitting buildings and crushing cars. A car hits a fallen tree, the driver is shown hanging out of the side window unconscious. A man jumps off a building in a suicide attempt but is saved by Mr. Incredible.

At that moment, the villains orders a rocket launch and the fiery exhaust of the rocket sweeps down the tube and the kids barely manage to escape outside in time. Once most of Parr's family reaches Syndrome's island, the mother warns her children that the enemies they face are a deadly threat to them and the kids must use their powers to their fullest extent since they will be fighting for their lives. Mr. Incredible saves a man from a suicide attempt.

He menacingly says that she should show them the same hospitality that he did before. Then the crew members start touching and groping her menacingly - some tug at her clothes. This is stopped soon though William and Elizabeth share a kiss. There are some sexual references. Elizabeth wears a white dress that gets wet. Her nipples and the outline of her breasts can be seen vaguely. Dresses reveal cleavage. During a sword fight with Will, Jack suggests that Will found a love interest and is ""unable to woo said strumpet"" and then asks him if he is a eunuch. ""Strumpet"" is a dated term for a female prostitute and ""eunuch"" refers to a castrated man. Two men tell a girl she will be forced to dine naked with the crew, if she refuses to wear the dress that Barbossa instructed her to wear for dinner. The crew expresses disappointment when she says she'll dine with Barbossa. Elizabeth is told to take her dress off (although she is wearing a tight dress underneath so she is not naked). The man makes a remark about the dress still being ""warm"". Seduction is implied on a desert island scene when Elizabeth pretends to be drunk and seductive in order to get Jack to drink more. Two women slap Captain Jack Sparrow about him with ""another woman."" Near by the beginning when the pirates come to Port royal there is a massive fight include: slashings stabbings and Shootings they're fairly violent and intense Barbossa shoots one of his crew to see if they are still cursed. Action/Adventure violence and very mild blood In an early scene, we see men turn into gruesome, decaying skeletons when hit by the moonlight. Multiple scenes involving pirates sword fighting and gunfire, with some individuals that are stabbed or shot (non-graphic). A man is shot in the chest and blood soaks his shirt then he falls over dead. Dead pirate corpses are seen hung by nooses. (no blood) A tomahawk axe digs into a pirate's back, but no blood is shown when retrieved. A pirate is stabbed (not shown), then we see blood on the retracted knife. The pirate is cursed to be undead and so survives. Pirates raid a village, and in one scene, a butler opens the door to a mansion and is immediately shot by pirates. A pirate with a fake eye gets a fork stuck in his eye. He takes the fork out and you can see his fake eye on the fork. There is a fairly intense battle scene between the living and the undead, but it is done under moonlight and nothing overly graphic is shown. However, it could be considered quite frightening. An undead sailor slits the throat of a soldier. You see it from behind but it is still very violent. Some drinking. Characters are shown drunk. Jack was drinking beer in a scene This is about pirates, so expect use of alcohol. Lots of rum use The scene where Elizabeth first sees Barbossa and his crew as undead skeletons (which are apparently their true form) is rather creepy In an early scene, Jack Sparrow sees some corpses on nooses implied to be from pirates that were executed by hanging and put there as a warning to other pirates. Some Scary Moments There are visuals that show various sights of pirates that turn (completely or partially) into living skeletons (and partially decomposed bodies) when moonlight hits them. Hanged corpses are seen multiple times. There is a very intense scene where pirates raid a village and kill people, and at one point you see a structure collapse on a little boy. The mom saves the boy just in time, though. 1 use of""Shit"" 1 ""shit"",1 ""bastard"", 1 ""damn"", 2 ""damned"", 4 ""Hell"", 1""Scum""' 2 "" 5 ""bloody"" and some (rather dated) name-callings and insults such as ""eunuch"" (used twice), ""strumpet"", ""scum"" and ""cur"".

One sex scene shows bare breasts, kissing, and breast-groping. At least two sex scenes with little to nothing shown. In another scene the sounds of sex are clearly heard through a wall, though nothing shown. A man lifts up a woman's skirt while holding her close to him. A man & a woman make out in front of a baby. A man headbutts a cashier in the face, giving him a bloody nose. A gun is pointed at a dog's head. A dog gets shot in the stomach in the midst of a dog fight. A man stabs another man in the stomach. The stabbing and gory wound are visible. A hitman holds a pistol to his tied-up, gagged victim's head; the victim is shown sweating in fear. A man gets kidnapped at a grocery store and then beaten to a bloody pulp by a group of men. Stitch marks are briefly visible on a woman's broken leg at a hospital. There is a very intense car chase during which there is a wounded dog in the back seat. The dogs bloody wound can be seen clearly. It is disturbing. A man is shot in the chest. A very violent car crash; the crash is shown multiple times. A woman can be seen pressed against the window of her car as she is screaming and many of her appendages are clearly broken; she is later pulled out of the car. The aftermath is shown with great detail and it is disturbing and graphic. A man is pulled out of his car; he has a broken leg, there is blood everywhere, and he screams in agony. His passenger is dead, with his face covered in blood. In the first third of the film, there are many instances of dogfighting. The fights themselves are intense and very violent, but mostly take place offscreen. The aftermath is very graphic and unpleasant to look at. Many dead, bloody dogs shown. One dog has a ""snapped neck,"" and other dogs are missing large patches of skin. Blood is all over the floor at the dog-fighting ring. A person is beaten with a rod in the shower. A hitman offers rum to his tied-up victim. Many characters frequently smoke and drink. It is also inferred that a few of the younger characters smoke marijuana.

While the men in the chain gang are watching a very sensual scene comes up, a woman in a tight, thin dress washes a car, she bends over, her cleavage is shown, and she presses her body against the window glass and there is a close up of her. This can be seen in the trailer. No nudity is shown but it feels like it is. The men are often shown in their bunks wearing nothing but underwear briefs. When the new men return from their first day of work, one of them is sentenced to the box. He undresses and his bare buttocks are seen from behind. It is not sexual. One character has a book describing an encounter and on two occasions reads out loud from it -- but it doesn't specifically describe sex. Later, when Luke is sentenced to the box, his bare buttocks are also seen. There is one instance of bloody violence towards the end of the movie. Very intense prison physical and mental violence. A raw box fighting between Luke and a big guy with a little display of blood. A convict gets beaten up repatedly with sticks. A prison ''boss'' is attacked by a convict who almost strangles him. The prisoners force a man to eat lots of boiled eggs. He lies unconscious on the table. Prisoners are seen being beaten by guards (not a lot of blood is shown). In several scenes Luke is badly injured and unable to stand or walk properly. Some characters are seen smoking cigarettes. A dog's corpse is shown, it is said that he died of exhaustion from chasing after an escaped prisoner. There is no blood. 'The Man With No Eyes' is very intimidating. The BBFC should re rate the film a 12 certificate for moderate violence, sex references 'Son of a bitch' is used a couple of times A few mild profanities, but not very many.

During a song, the oldest daughter (16) asks the Captain if she can taste champagne. He refuses. It's insinuated that some pink lemonade the adults are drinking has alcohol in it, commenting ""...its not too sweet . It's not too sour. It's just too pink"" The Nazi flag is displayed prominently in two scenes, and Nazi soldiers are seen marching. The family gets chased by the Nazi soldiers near the end. No one gets hurt or killed.

On another occasion a man says he wants to be a woman so that he can have babies. Another characters says to him that he can't have babies because he hasn't got a womb. A lengthy scene shows a fully nude woman after she gets out of bed. Breasts, nipples, and her butt are all seen at various times, but her genitalia is constantly visible, however she has a lot of hair on her genitals so a lot of the detail is covered by her pubic hair. Graphic but not sexual. While you always see her whole body, her hairy genitals are her most prominently displayed body part in this scene. Brian encounters a nude man sitting in a hole. He has a beard that is long enough to cover full frontal nudity, although we get shots of his behind showing his testicles for a few frames and also his buttocks. This character is not meant to be arousing and is played for laughs. There is one scene where a man and woman wake up nude. Then the women is seen nude as she gets out of bed, pubic hair, buttocks, and breasts are shown. The man walks over to the window and his buttocks are shown. Then the man opens the window and we get a full frontal shot with his penis on full display. Towards the beginning of the film, a woman is seen picking up a bunch of dismembered pieces of people. Fairly gory but somewhat comical. Contains some mild comedic violence which has some blood and gore, body parts, and may upset or disturb younger viewers. Other scenes include a stoning sequence, a mass crucifixion, a lynch mob and a group suicide. Wine is mentioned in one scene. People are crucified at the end of the film. May offend some. The ending is probably the most powerful ending to a movie consisting completely of jokes. Rated R for graphic nudity, language, and brief violence Those who are very religious should stay clear of this film.

This spawned criticism from the American Arab anti-discrimination committee for cultural insensitivity, so the 2004 special edition and later releases replaced this line with one that talks about the intense heat. A large barrel-shaped tower section rolls toward Aladdin and Abu. They escape harm by going to where a small opening hits the ground. None."

It is revealed she has been hit by her husband. Celia has a miscarriage, and we see her on the bathroom floor, a brief image of (a lot) of blood between her legs, as she screams. She later buries the child in her front yard, with her other miscarriages. She has never told her husband. Virtually everyone, Skeeter included, smokes. And in a self-conscious wink at people's attitudes toward smoking during that era, Skeeter's boss says, ""I guarantee you one day they're going to figure out that cigarettes kill you."" Social drinking is almost as frequent as the smoking. Many scenes picture (white) people downing mixed drinks or martinis. A would-be-suitor for Skeeter is obviously drunk, and he keeps ordering shots. Celia is likewise inebriated at a socialite event, and is sick (off screen). Hilly drinks and drives in one scene.

Such as a moment where after Mansley meets Hogarth, he stumbles across his mother Annie only to find himself oogling her for about a split-second by quickly dragging his eyes from her hips all the way to her bust. We see a boy unzip his pants in a bathroom and is seen sitting on the toilet with his pants down, though his underwear is still on. A man unzips his fly and a squirrel jumps out (this is seen from behind). After the Iron Giant gets shot by tanks, bazookas, machine guns, armed aircraft and other types of military artillery, it starts obliterating many tanks and armored vehicles after going into attack mode from thinking they killed Hogarth. A deer is shot and killed by hunters. No blood is or wound is seen, only the body. A man goes through the window of a boat and is knocked onto rocks on the shore. Hogarth sprints into a tree branch and quickly wakes up with a nosebleed from the impact. Mansley grabs a Hogarth by the face and threatens him, and then swiftly knocks him out by putting a handkerchief laced with chloroform to the boy's face. Two boys almost fall off a roof; a boy gets knocked unconscious. The Iron Giant took a bite into a power station and gets electrocuted (the scene is very noisy and scary). A big robot carries a boy in his hand, towering above the trees, and the boy looks scared. We see a brain on TV that moves across the floor by itself. A lot of scatological humor (diarrhea, constipation). A man uses a chemical covered handkerchief to knock out a boy. Some locals attribute a fisherman's story about the giant to ""either whiskey or beer."" A government agent smokes and carries a pipe several times during the film. A boy watches an old horror movie on tv; a giant brain starts eating a man's head, but the scene is cut off. A fisherman's boat is sunk. Hogarth hears something either upstairs or on the roof and slowly goes to find the source of the noise. Later, Hogarth slowly makes his way through a darkened forest (with his flashlight) and follows the destructive path of something obviously quite large. In the ""Signature Edition"" a newly added scene shows the Giant having a dream containing his memories both on Earth and additionally shows a possibility where he originally came from. He remembers the other robots resembling him destroying a city and blowing up an entire planet which awakens him in fear. A couple of anatomical references, several scatological references and mild obscenities; some name-calling. ""Damn it"" is used by the antagonist's boss when he phones him at home; 1 other use of 'damn'. 2 uses of 'hell' as an expletive."

No nudity as it only shows her back. Woman takes her shirt off and is in a bra. A young woman uses a piece of broken pottery to cut deeply into her face. She then slices her neck open resulting with tons and tons of blood pouring out. Massive puddles of blood form. This scene is incredibly disturbing and bloody. A man is killed by a sustained series of bloody stabs to his body. He smiles at one point with blood leaking from his mouth. Several brutal sequences where supernatural entities rip off their faces in gory fashion. A man stabs himself with a pair of garden pliers in front of an elderly woman at a gas station, caught on a CCTV camera. Tons and tons of blood spray out of the man's body and all over the front a car. A picture is shown of a heavily mutilated face. Pictures of past suicides in the movie. Most of the pictures are incredibly gory and bloody. May upset some. A woman accidentally bites her thumb creating a cut, some blood is shown. The main character drinks wine to help her cope with post traumatic stress. Very intense and creepy-looking sketches. Plot involves and mentions suicide. Integral plot point. A woman twists her neck (offscreen) and bends her face upside down while smiling outside of a car window. Many solid jump scare scenes. One involving a mutilated face. The film sustains a strong sense of foreboding and threat throughout, with central themes of trauma and death. There are frequent jump scares and some very strong violence. Rose is listening to a recording of Laura on her laptop and keeps rewinding to investigate a low sound, the entity then appears next to her screaming her name, probably the most frighting scene as the jumpscare is quite unexpected This movie is incredibly scary and disturbing at the same time. 36 uses of ""fuck"" 1 use of ""Jesus Christ"""

An autopsy is shown; it is largely non graphic with split second shots of the organs. At one point the two people conducting the autopsy search through the subject's stomach contents. Again, non graphic. Flashbacks of two men having received multiple wounds and injuries are shown, in bloody detail. This is likely what the ""bloody images"" in the rating is referring to. This is the most graphic scene in the film, but still isn't very graphic. A man adjusts the alignment of a woman's broken wrist. This is off screen, but we still hear her groans of pain. A man is punched and smacked several times in the face, being knocked to the ground, causing his glass eye to fly out. Woman shoved in front of car, run over, body smashed underneath car. Frequent portrayals of alcohol, tobacco, and substance use in a recreational context. A man reveals that he was addicted to pain medication through a narration played over shots of him injecting said pain medication in his arm. Later, he is shown passed out in an alley way; whether or not this is from an overdose is never made clear. Although the character makes it clear that this is due to vertigo, a woman accuses said character of being drunk based on her constant stumbling. Two men use an eyedrop that numbs pain, said to be a steroid from Zurich. The aforementioned war flashbacks, and shots of the soldiers in the care units are admittedly pretty gnarly. They don't last long, but can be painful to watch The main character has a glass eye. May be disturbing to ommetaphobic viewers. A single use of ""fuck"", with a couple ""damn""s here and there."

The Griswald's neighbors make out and are seen with glasses of wine. A man tells his wife that he's going to take off his clothes and kiss every square inch of her body. There is a picture on the bedroom ceiling of the Griswald's house of a woman with skimpy clothing. A woman in a store shows Clark her very high underwear and it shows the side of her butt. The Christmas tree is shown with a bra as an ornament. It's meant to be funny and is non sexual. Ellen is shown grabbing Clark's crotch during the police officer scene where they tell the family to freeze. It is not in a sexual way. The violence is mostly meant to be funny: A man gets punched by his wife. He falls backwards off the couch and lands on his face. A man tumbles all the way down his stairs while holding wine glasses. The glasses are shattered. A block of ice from the rain gutter goes flying, crashes through the neighbor's window, and destroys their stereo.

There are several scenes of violence, including a man strangling another using a rope. There are brief bloody images. A man fights with the murderer and is strangled with a rope and then hit on the head with a sewing machine. His body is later found with blood on his shirt and head and coming out of his mouth. His tongue is said to have been cut off and it's briefly shown. (Not horribly graphic). A man is shot in the chest and leg. A bloody bullet hole appears on his chest and a brief blood spray is seen coming out of his leg. He is then hit on the head with a snow shovel. Blood is seen pooling around his head. All very brief. A man is strangled to death. A closeup of his face shows his eyes bulging and bloodshot. Not graphic but might be considered frightening. A man is shot in the shoulder and some blood is shown on his shirt. A man accidentally drinks rat poison and dies. Not graphic and played for laughs. A brief shootout and and explosion. Four people die throughout the movie. Several fistfights and hitting with blunt objects. Strangling and shooting. Some seems with mild to moderate blood shown. 10 misuses of God's name Lots of drinking, with two characters in particular drinking to excess frequently and getting visibly drunk. Surprisingly no smoking though.  The words ""hell"", ""damn"", ""g*ddamn"", ""ass"", ""bastard"", ""bloody"", ""shit"" and ""horseshit"" are heard in the film."

The Na'vi people are aliens, but they are humanoid creatures. They dress in a tribal way, and we see their backsides (not fully covered by their tails) quite a bit. The men wear only loincloths, and the women wear loincloths and ornamental, stringy necklaces as bras. A brief suggestive between Jake and Neytiri shows the two kissing and beginning to passionately caress each other. There is no nudity, but they wake together the next morning, and Neytiri explains they are ""mated for life."" In the extended edition, this scene includes the two touching their queues together, implying they can ""feel"" each other (as explained earlier in the film). A few sexual jokes and lines are tossed about, including a masturbation quip from Dr. Augustine (""don't play with that, you'll go blind"" when she sees Jake playing with his queue). The battle at the end is extremely violent and many creatures and humans die. Some deaths are presented in extremely gruesome and extensive detail. The final battle shows people and aliens blown up, stabbed, shot by guns, shot by arrows, and run over. On scene, and in gruesome details. An unfortunate humans' head and shoulders end up in a banshees mouth. Explosions consume man, alien and beast alike. On fire, a horse-like creature runs for its life. Neytiri kills a human with two well-placed shots. Aerial clashes involve banshees vs. the humans aircraft. And while the Navi get mowed down by missiles and gunfire, many of their arrows somehow penetrate cockpits, taking out pilots and gunners, by shots to the face and chest, shown onscreen. Neytiri takes out a viperwolf with an arrow. It contains innocuous alcohol consumption and a reference to smoking. A woman has a drink that's presumably alcoholic. Beer and tequila are mentioned a couple of times. A woman smokes several times, and at one point asks for a cigarette with urgency. (Extended Edition): an early scene take place in a bar on Earth, with Jake apparently participating in a drinking contest. Jake pulls a cigarette out of Grace's mouth and tells her not to smoke. The final battle in the film between the humans and Na'vi is intense and emotional, considering that we see scores of soldiers (on both sides) get stabbed, shot, impaled and crushed by gunfire, arrow piercings and falling objects. Jake has several close encounters with native creatures, which may be intense and in several scenes, they chase him in an attempt to kill and eat him. Several positive characters are killed or mortally wounded on-screen during the movie, which may be disturbing for the audience. The home media releases of the film include a more family-friendly version of the movie that substitutes the swearing for cleaner alternatives. 'Sh*t' is said at least 11 times. 'Godd*mn' is said at least eight times. 'H*ll' is said six times. '*ss' is said four times. 'D-*mn' is said four times. 'Crap' is said three times. 'B*tch' is said three times. 'D*ck' is said twice. 'B*stard' is said once. 'Son of a b*tch' is said once. 'Screw' is said three times. 'P*ss' is said three times. 'Balls' is said once in a vulgar context. 'Cripple' is said once as an insult."

Morticia and Gomez have a chat in the graveyard talking about their honeymoon. They share a passionate makeout scene on a tombstone shaped like a couch. Fester sticks his finger in the ear of a conjoined twin in a manner which is supposed to be sexual. Morticia wears a revealing skin-tight black dress with low cleavage throughout the film. As Tully uses a torture device on Morticia, she moans before smiling and saying to him, ""you've done this before."" While Morticia is on the torture death wheel (about to get poked with red hot pokers) Gomez comes in and as he unties the leather straps that are holding her down he says ""Leather straps and red hot pokers"" and she replies with ""Later my dearest"" Refering to them being kinky/freaky. At the end of the movie Gomez asks Morticia what more they could ask for. Morticia pulls out a baby outfit she had knitted. He asks if it's true. And they share a long kiss. Morticia wakes up and tells Gomez that last night he was ""like an animal"" and tells him, among other things, that he ""frightened"" her. She is aroused by this and says ""do it again."" Morticia and Gomez make out 3 times in the movie. In one scene, Morticia and Gomez are seen kissing (neck, cheeks, hands, arms, ect) in public. They become so passionate that it is implied they reached orgasm. The camera cuts away before anything is shown. You can however hear their cries of ecstacy. This scene is very short though. A married character falls in love with somebody other than the spouse. Morticia frightens a room of schoolchildren by telling them to imagine how the witch felt as she was burned alive in the Hansel and Gretel fairy-tale. This causes the children to cry. Lurch belches a ball of fire and subsequently burns a woman who is standing outside a building. A woman aims a gun at Gomez and then threatens to murder Morticia. Some dark humor. A girl runs after her brother with a knife, but her mother takes it away and surprisingly, gives her an axe instead and she chases her brother with that. A boy is strapped to an electric chair, though nothing is shown and the boy survives seemingly unscathed. Some torture devices are displayed. Towards the end, there is a very graphic scene which shows Pugsley and Wednesday in a school play, battling it out with swords. Later it is revealed that the swords are real, and blood spews from wounds as Pugsley and Wednesday hack off each other's fake limbs from the costumes. Gomez smokes cigars throughout the movie. The whole final scene of the movie is intense. The family have a creepy and morbid nature. The crawling hand, although no blood is shown. Several creepy sights from their house and graveyard. Lots of mild cussing such as damn, hell, bloody, bugger, idiot, fool, and more Contains religious exclamations. Five ""damn's"", at least."

He then comments that there's ""no clothes on anybody. Sickening"". No nudity. Buzz asks his cousin if it's true that French babes don't shave their pits and says they've got nude beaches. Harry says 'I'll snap off your cojones' when threatening Kevin. Kevin puts aftershave on his face in two scenes, which causes him to scream once he realizes how painful it is. This is not violent at all and meant for comedic effect A man walks into a shop with blood stained gauze on his hand. Kevin watches a movie called Angels with Filthy Souls and a deal between two gangster-type characters goes awry, with the character named Johnny killing another man with a machine gun, which frightens Kevin. It is kind of graphic, smoke can be seen and Johnny laughs sadistically while killing the man. Black and white. The scene is repeated two times more later in the film, but used for comic effect. Comedic action and slapstick violence: Kevin climbs the shelf in Buzz's room and it breaks, he and everything falls. Kevin shoots action figures down the laundry chute with Buzz's BB gun. Kevin sets traps for the bad guys. They burn themselves, step on stuff that hurts, fall on stuff etc. They step on spikes and ornaments that hurt their feet, while wearing no shoes nor socks, get hit in the head with an iron, slip on ice, and get hit with a paint can. In one scene near the beginning there is a drunk man on TV. You can barely hear him. Mild drinking on the plane. A man dressed as Santa Claus smokes a cigarette. The stories of Old Man Marley, a.k.a. ""The Shovel Slayer"" are particularly disturbing, but he turns out to be very nice. In two iconic scenes, Kevin puts aftershave on his face and due to how painful it proves to be, it causes him to scream. Several scenes show a pet tarantula which may be jarring to those who are scared of spiders. Kevin's rude behavior towards his mom might be saddening Robbers are threatening towards Kevin. The slapstick finale is comically intended yet some of the booby traps (For example; one of the robbers steps bare foot on a rusty nail sticking up on the floor) can be fairly disturbing/cringeworthy. No blood is ever shown in these sequences. A few mild swears here and now and then. A-word and H-word used occasionally Shit is used once or twice"

A woman kills a goose with a pitchfork. You see her carrying its bloody corpse on the pitchfork to feed to an alligator. A woman imagines her husband, who's in the war, exploding in a gory fashion for a full second. She is immediately seen popping an alligator egg in her hand, letting it ooze in a bloody mess. A pig roast is left on a farmer's porch and gets maggots over the course of the film. A woman chases another woman with an ax, striking her from behind three separate times. The camera cuts away as she brings it down for the killing blow. Not long after, she is seen hacking the body into pieces and feeding them to an alligator. You see the woman's bloody, severed head for a few seconds. There are some scenes of strong bloody violence throughout the film, but it focuses more on the shock value and gore than the actual violence. All of the violence in the movie is made to look similar to technicolor style 30's film. Bright red blood with detail. A man and woman smoke in an alley for a brief scene. A woman drinks her father's cold medicine. At The End Of The Movie Pearl Smiles In A Very Creepy And Disturbing Way During The Credits

A female character suggests to a male character, that if he wants someone to spend a night in his tent, ""there are girls in the market who will do that"". Frequent strong battle scenes with spears, knives, ropes and fingernails. Characters are stabbed and throats are slit. Domestic/sexual violence includes an older suitor punching a young woman he's expressing marital interest in. A woman mentions that she was raped with very non-graphic flashbacks. A man is seen cut into three pieces (his head, torso, and lower body). Graphic but lasts about half a second. Has very violent, graphic material all throughout the movie. One of the characters has a liking for whiskey. Adults are seen casually drinking whiskey. This movie is very violent for a PG-13 movie. There are a lot of heavy themes and the violence is quite graphic at times. "

Injury detail is largely limited to small bloody cuts and sprays of golden or purple blood from fantasy creatures and characters. A god is stabbed in the throat quite suddenly and golden blood spills down his neck. Then he is either decapitated or hewn in half off screen. And alien creature's head gets ripped right off in front of the children with its purple blood dripping down to scare them. somewhat shocking and gross (though the creature is rather ugly and worm like) A woman is bloodied from battle and loses her arm (not really shown until later) Shadow monsters attack a village and kill and throw people around. they take all types of scary forms. The goriest moment is when Thor first tries to summon Mjölnir and as it gets closer to him, it rips through a giant monster. Purple blood and gore is seen spraying everywhere although it gets blurred out, it still remains quite gory. Much more violent and gory in comparison with previous Thor movies. Alien gore and blood is clearly shown. Alien creatures are brutally killed with big sledgehammer (flesh pieces and purple blood is seen). Ancient god is killed with big sword in his throat (some gold blood spruits form his throat) and then decapitated. A woman lost her hand (not so explicit, but still upsetting). Some alcohol, such as beer, champagne and wine are shown. Some of the monsters and villains may be scary for some viewers. Several empathetic characters are in danger or injured. 'Sh*t' is said at least thirteen times.

She is wearing a white bra and panties before putting on her biking clothes. A man and a woman kiss 2 times. No sex scenes. The first one is rather passionate and the second one is brief. A few rather quick kisses. A photo is shown of the mayor in a compromising pose with a suggestively dressed woman who is not his wife, implying infidelity. Penguin makes a crude joke about this. A naked (blurred) woman can be seen dancing in the bar. A girl entres the penguin's club. The camera shows suggestively dressed women dancing. Bruce Wayne is seen shirtless a few times. After Bruce Wayne leaves the club, a poster of a suggestive woman can be seen on a wall near the train tracks in the background. Easy to miss. Several action sequences that include shootings, fistfights, electrocutions, and sequences in which people are repeatedly punched or bludgeoned. However most of this is off-screen or no blood is shown Mutilated bodies are found at crime scenes, and there is repeated views of a severed thumb. A man is hit with a metal tool while sitting in his car. A mans get hits hard to the face with a bat. Batman shoots a grapple hook through an attacker's leg and then hangs him from it. No blood and this scene is darkly lit, which makes it hard to see clearly Intense action sequences throughout. The first action scene takes place in a subway station. A gang of clowns want to assault a man but Batman comes in and takes all of them down with punches. He also electrocutes one man and slams him onto a wall before dropping him with rage Batman is seen flying around the city. When he lands, he ends up hitting a truck and violently falling. The tone however, is slightly comedic rather than shocking. A man is shot in the back of the neck by a sniper's bullet. Though the actual act is obscured and brief, a few drops of blood are shown on the man's face and glasses as he dies. Batman kicks off the attackers, who are attached to zip-lines, and are shown as if they were hanging. Part of the plot revolves around a fictitious drug business; the drug consists of drops placed in people's eyes. Addicts are called ""dropheads"". Much of the movie revolves around a drug ring. Several scenes where characters drink. A man under the influence of alcohol or drugs is overly talkative. Towards the climax Batman injects what seems to be adrenaline to keep fighting Multiple scenes take place in a club/bar Scenes include people in states of terror and distress after being placed in elaborate death traps. The tone is frequently dark and menacing, and includes scenes of gun threat and acts of terrorism. The Riddler is a very frightening killer. His costume resembles The Zodiac Killer's. His presence is very menacing. He tends to act slightly psychotic as well, rapidly accelerating his pace of words and/or snapping at seemingly nothing, which can be unsettling at times. The whole film is extremely intense. Batman is intense in this movie. 'Godd*mn' is said six times. 'D*ckbag' is said once. 'F*ck' is said once. 'Prick' is said once as an insult. 'B*stard' is said. 'Son of a b*tch' is said five times. 'Sh*t' is said seven times. 'H*ll' is said seven times. '*ss' is said twice and '*sshole' is said once. 'Gimp' is said once as an insult."

Buddy sees a kid miles running away, and throws a snowball at his back causing him to fall Buddy gets into a fight with the Santa at the department store, because he believes he's an imposter. There is some punching and kicking, but no blood or gore. Buddy sees a person with dwarfism in his father's office and truly believes that he is an elf. This makes the man very angry, and he runs across the table and attacks Buddy. There is no blood, however. While in the doctor's office, Buddy receives a finger prick. He screams, but there is no blood. This is made for comedic purposes. A man is seen smoking while in prison. We hear that gnomes weren't used at the North Pole because they drink too much (and see one doing that, followed by a loud belch). In the mailroom, men drink and get drunk.

Deaths occur offscreen but audible, and the aftermath is shown (sunken in faces) The characters fight almost exclusively using close combat knives and swords, so there are several fight scenes including stabbing and cutting throats (never shown up close but in wide angle) Many people are hung upside down and drained of blood so that the Sardaukhar Army may receive blood marks on their forehead as a ceremony into their army. A character is impaled by a dart which in turn paralyzes him. A bit of blood and a injury detail is seen including a bloody hand and knife A character is slapped and later gut punched brutally when tied up. Scenes include close-quarters combat with bladed weapons, including slashes and stabbings resulting in brief sight of blood. There is occasional focus on bloodied blades, or blood on hands and clothes. Other sequences depict large scale attacks in which ships and buildings are bombed and explode, and a number of deaths caused by toxic gas A character grabs another man by the hair and hoists him up as he brings up a blade to his neck and slices. The camera cuts away but you hear the squelch of the blade decapitating the man. Next shot shows the character briefly holding the severed head before dropping it, but no gore is shown as it is blocked by a table in the foreground. There is a fictional hallucinogenic drug named ""spice"" that plays a pivotal role in the films plot, but it is not shown being abused. Mild alcohol use. The fremen have blue eyes due to spice addiction. Paul breathes in the spice melange in one scene. A man is implied to be drugged. There are several intense battle scenes Two characters fight to the death in a knife duel Two characters fight for their survival by using their powers to make their captors kill each other. We see a mostly silhouetted creature that looks like it's composed of various human parts, and crawls around on several human arms. We don't see it very well but it is disturbing. Characters are swallowed by a massive frightening sandworm. Scenes of threat include characters being pursued and attempting to escape giant worms, flying through a sandstorm, fleeing from explosions, being held at knife point, and being targeted by remote devices that inject poison. A character is left paralysed by poison, and his body is seen naked in a chair as his enemies mock him ""The Voice"" that is used by the Bene Gesserit is intense and frightening. The sandworms are quite frightening, appearing as extremely gruesome and gigantic leech-like creatures that borrow beneath the dunes of Arrakis, have lamprey-like mouths with thousands of baleen-like structures, resembling human eyes seen up-close. 3 uses of damn, 1 use of hell, 1 use of ass, 1 use of shit 'Damn' is said three times.

A young man appears nude and we see a full frontal pose (his genital area is covered), jumps onto the back of another young man and we then see the nude man from the back and side (bare buttocks are visible); while struggling, the nude man asks the other man out on a date several times and receives no answer. During a shaky, windy scene, a dozen dismembered arms, thighs, hands, and feet drop from the sky and we see each one, very red, with a bone sticking out (they look like plastic). Four young adults enter a storeroom in the darkness and hear flapping wings, mechanical chipmunks with wide, yellow-ring irises use demonic voices to sing unintelligible lyrics. One foams at the mouth and they all fly and chase the four people, biting them (no blood) on the shoulders, necks, backs. And on the genitals of one male (through clothing); the people beat the chipmunks with metal poles and then trap them in a metal garbage can (we hear grunting, screaming, crying, crunching and thudding), the chipmunks knock down a pregnant teen and eat her back (we see ribs and vertebrae and a small amount of blood and gore.) A young woman eats a beer bottle (we see her very bloody mouth and blood runs down the left side of her chin), and the scene cuts to her on a street outside with friends (no blood). A young woman rides in a car, steps out into broken glass and her bare toes are shown completely bloodied (when she walks into a nearby building, her toes show no blood or injury at all). A large meteor strikes a sidewalk, the camera pans around it and we see the top half of a young woman (she shows no pain and sings commercials). A man falls from the sky to impale himself on a sword held by another man: there is no blood, and the scene ends abruptly. A boulder falls onto a young woman: she disappears, we see no injury and a man screams, ""They killed her, they killed her."" A young woman runs up to a race car, pulls the driver from the car, throws him to the ground, takes an automatic handgun from his pocket, empties two clips of ammo shooting at him (off camera) and she and two friends take the car and drive away. In four scenes we see young adults (two women and two men) shot between the eyes, with the bullet going in and leaving a red circle. In a museum, a young woman is pinned to the floor by the spear of a statue that has fallen forward, we see a streak of blood from her shoulder, three other young people enter the room, one man drops a vase on her head to knock her out but fails, another man punches her in the face and head- butts her twice, she is punched in the face again several times, and the statue is pulled off her and she gets up (her shoulder shows no wound). A young man throws a spear in a museum and jumps onto the back of another young man and they struggle, falling into glass cases and shattering them; no injuries occur. A pregnant teen is shown from the chest-up while, seemingly, her legs come up and kick a man in the face several times without effort; a slimy baby's leg comes up and kicks the man's face as well, it is pushed into the man's mouth and the teen says, ""Suck it!"" The opening sequence is obscured by a very wide black band that runs completely across the middle of the screen, we hear animal growls and see running bare feet and then a bare shoulder in a jungle; when the band disappears it reveals a young bare-chested man lying back on the ground in a close up, another young man in a wrestling singlet stands over him and challenges him to an American Gladiators duel with padded batons, and they struggle and strike each other (there are no visible injuries). A martial arts fight occurs between a giant panda dressed in shorts and a young man: they scuffle, grimace, and screech, use bamboo poles (neither is injured), then break the poles in half and use them to fight again (no one is injured) and the panda is knocked down and the scene ends. A man throws a cable, it sticks to a car, he is dragged down the street and around the corner and reappears unharmed, but dirty, in another scene. A dwarf slams through a stone wall and is unharmed. A young man accidentally hits a young woman in the face with the tip of a whip and we see a red mark. A young man swings on a whip from a ceiling light and an Earth tremor ends the scene. A large paper-maché cow falls onto two men and onto a trio of large mechanical chipmunks; we do not see any injuries and all the characters reappear in other scenes. Two young men in separate scenes are struck in the crotch and bend over in pain, but recover quickly. Throughout the film, young adults slap one another in the face. An earthquake shakes a party hall, everyone runs outside screaming and crying, but no one is hurt; additional tremors occur throughout the film, but no one is injured. Emergency radio broadcasts warn of danger three times and a crowd at a party screams and runs outside each time. We see a large dinosaur skeleton in a dark museum, we see footprints from the skeleton, and men and women scream. A homeless man in dirty clothing sleeps on a bus stop bench and an 8-year-old boy yells insults at him, goes away and the man falls off the bench to end the scene. Throughout the film, a pregnant teen lifts her shirt to show her abdomen, break dances with spinning on her bare abdomen on the ground, sprays milk from both breasts while still clothed (we see this from behind) into the face of a man until he is drenched from head to chest, and ejects the slimy foot of the fetus (we see only the foot, not her genitals) to kick a man in the face and states that her water is breaking. A young woman impersonating Amy Winehouse comes out from behind a tree in a field and has hair two feet high, saber tooth fangs, black and rotten teeth, and tattoos on her right arm, left shoulder, abdomen, and left top of breast. After chugging a gallon of scotch, a young woman burps for a full minute into the face of a young man and then burps several times more. A young man sits on a couch filled with food of all types and stuffs his mouth messily. A pregnant teen pours a pint of vodka into a gallon of orange juice and chugs it at a party, saying it is time to get the baby drunk. A young woman takes a gallon of scotch out of her big hairdo and chugs it (she does not seem affected by it), Two party scenes show hundreds of bottles of beer and wine. Young men and women are shown holding cups and bottles of beer, half-filled glasses of wine, tall glasses of liquor and a few take sips. A man asleep on a bus stop bench rolls off and a bottle of whiskey rolls away on the sidewalk. Bottles of wine are shown on a coffee table in a living room. Two young men fill tote bags with liquor bottles to take away from a party, but drop them when the building begins to shake and the scene ends. Song lyrics contain the phrase ""hooked on reefer."" A young woman holds a cigar in her mouth briefly in a quick camera pan over her face -- the cigar is unlit. None. This is meant to be a comedy The only thing frightening about this movie is the fact that it was made in the first place. 20 uses of shit 2 used as shitty 2 with bull 8 uses of hell 1 use of whore, tits, dick, Jesus christ, hoe, slut, bastard, piss, oh god, screw and bloody 5 uses of bitch 8 uses of ass 2 with hole 3 uses of damn 1 with god People sing the total drama song while saying the s word many times Name-calling. Words include: douche, hoe, stink-eye, battlecross galactica, sea monkey, crackhead, witch, LL Not Cool J, Moorish Ruffian, dark muffin, dark prince, and crazy. Stereotypical remarks that reduce women to brainless sexual objects and insult transvestites, dwarves, black people, and men in general. Harlem is said to be a ghetto. Many sexual references including the F-word were removed from the original US unrated version to make the film get a PG-13 rating."

In one case, a couple making out in the woods is attacked by monsters before they can get very far. There is, however, a significant amount of breast nudity in the early going. One girl at the rave is topless. We see a home video recording of another later on. A girl goes for a swim at a secluded beach. She strips to a thong and is shown otherwise naked for the next few minutes. Dancers wear provocative outfits. Most of the human deaths are surprisingly restrained. Not a lot of gore. The victims are simply swarmed by zombies. An exception finds a young man bleeding from the mouth before a zombie arm bursts through his back and out his stomach. The undead, however, bite the dust in large numbers and extremely graphic fashion (usually to the tune of gangsta rap or loud techno music). Creatures are hacked with axes and shot at close range. Others get picked off in hails of automatic weapons fire. Blood sprays. Limbs fly. Heads explode or get crushed underfoot. Grenades and dynamite take out more still. Some of the evil dead are more human than others, including those adolescent party animals who havent decomposed much in the past few hours (perhaps all of that alcohol helped to preserve them; we dont know). Regardless, seeing people forced to kill their zombified friends is more disturbing than watching them whack a faceless corpse. For example, a rabid Cindy attacks her peers and is sent flying by a blast, then put down for good with a bullet to the forehead. A mans hand is impaled. Another has his neck broken. A man is hanged. A zombie tries to drown a woman. A boys face is severely burned. A man gets stabbed in the face. A sword fight ends with a girl being run through and her foe being decapitated. Beer is the beverage of choice. Guys drink it on the way to the rave. Couples carry bottles of brew with them as they prepare to have sex. Upon arriving at the deserted party, Greg and Simon are so single-mindedly drawn to the unsupervised keg and other booze that they dont worry a bit where everyone is or why the place is trashed. Kirk drinks from a flask and smokes cigars. Most of the movie is gory and violent, which could disturb some. Creatures pop into view from the wings and are picked off as they do. Several people sacrifice themselves for the good of the group. The zombies may frighten some young viewers. 19 f*** words

Loki shoots at Tim repeatedly in various scenes, with cartoonish excess. Otis the dog tries to give Alvey a firecracker disguised as a rattle; Alvey gives it back disguised as a bone and it blows up the dog. Alvey and Otis the dog fight violently (at one point swinging the dog by the tail so he hits all the walls in the room, smashing furniture, etc. and then blows the dog up after it surrenders with a white flag -- this sequence is very violent, though all cartoonish). Otis the dog imagines putting a bomb in Alvey's diaper, shooting him out of a cannon, spinning him in a ceiling fan, and tarring and feathering him. Alvey turns all this around and does it to the dog, including sending him through one of those laundry wringers, flattening him (but both are okay afterwards). Loki, Tim, and Alvey fight violently, using guns, electricity, explosives, and garbage dumpsters (Alvey works magic to slam Loki between them). They look charred at times (in a cartoon fashion, but are otherwise okay later). Loki wields a giant axe, and later, a hammer, smashing the sidewalk around Tim. Loki throws an oversized hand grenade at Tim and Alvey; and the baby puts up a shield. There's a boxing match between Tim as the Mask and Loki. Otis the dog, while under the influence of the mask, bites someone's crotch. At a nightclub, background characters hold drinks. At a nightclub, some characters may be smoking in the background, while a girl in a skimpy costume sells cigarettes  4 uses of hell and damn 6 uses of crap

Few minor kissing scenes. The main villain guns down several cows including shorting the legs off in an attempt to frighten the humans. A fair amount of explosions and gunshots, with some spontaneous deaths and clear view of some dead bodies. Little to no blood. The climax contains much destruction and fiery loss of life. The main villian's (Terl and his clerk named Ker) get intoxicated in a handful of scenes. Some characters smoke cigarettes in some scenes. They are so many scenes in which Terl and his friends drink green alien alcoholic beverages at a bar. The way the villains enslave and torment humans can be extremely unsettling. The CGI is terrible, so that might unsettle some people A small step above Star Trek-level sci-fi action intensity. The antagonistic race and the main villain in particular show a discomforting lack of empathy and concern for the lives of their subordinate human captives and even each other, leading to several ""pointless"" deaths. One scene has the main villain laughing while two humans wrestle over one oxygen mask in an inhospitable atmosphere. Some occasional profanity like Damn, Hell, and Crap Terl says ""Well, I'll be damned"" in one scene."

No nudity A woman climbs into bed with a man, she's in a bra, she sits on top of him, then he rolls her over and he thrusts briefly. They are both semi-covered with sheets. Frequent and extreme graphic violence. The movie involves supernatural animalistic creatures: four legged beings with large teeth, jaws and claws, they have long tails with spines and are covered in armor-like shells. Many humans look and act like zombies: they have ashen skin, darkened eyes, and they are snarling, lunging, etc. A man discovers a woman twitching on the ground, and we see that her head has been split in half, with lots of blood pouring out, and the man turns around and is surrounded by snarling creatures that apparently attack him (we hear him yell). A man opens a large chest, we hear loud growling and snapping, we hear men screaming, and then we see many dead men with blood around and on them, and one man with a hole through his chest. Many snarling and growling creatures run through dark woods toward people, many armed people shoot at the creatures, some of them are hit, and some people are attacked; we see bodies being flung through the air, and we hear screamings. A man's heavily armed commandos prepare themselves for an onslaught of alien-type monsters that are rapidly approaching. They then open fire on the creatures, killing many of them, but some get through and attack and kill the commandos. Helicopter gun ships then arrive and open fire on the monsters, but one manages to cause one chopper to crash into the other and both explode (presumably killing everyone onboard both). A man is attacked by a creature that pulls his arm and part of his chest off (we hear squishing, and see blood and matter as the man slumps to the ground and dies). Lights flicker on and off in a museum, a man investigates with a flashlight, a creature rears up behind him, grabs his head in its claw and squeezes, then pokes a claw through the back of the man's head and out his mouth, killing him. His bloody corpse is found by a man and a woman. A man falls through an opening in the floor and is impaled on many spikes below (we see his bloody body); a large stone slab falls crushing him and we see blood oozing from under the stone. A man jumps from a crosswalk onto another man, they fight, one is thrown through a window, and the other man jumps through the window and tackles him, knocking his head against the floor. A man is shot in the head and a man holds three other people at gunpoint. A man is hit in the chest by a thrown knife. Many armed people shoot at creatures. We see creatures being hit with matter splattering, and we see people being attacked with matter splattering as they are impaled by creatures' spiked claws and tails. Many infected people attack armed people. We see one infected person punching a hole in a man's chest, another infected person breaks a man's neck, and some infected people are shot, and others are impaled (one is impaled rather slowly). Several infected people attack a man; he shoots them, one is hit with an axe, a creature breaks a door down, chases the man and a woman, and the man shoots it and it turns into a cloud of dust. A man hits another man on the head, grabs his grenade and pulls the pin. The resultant explosion kills them and destroys a generator. A man and a woman hide in a room, a creature finds them, begins to break the door down, pokes a claw through the door cutting the woman's arm (we see some blood), and the man shoots it. A man finds his wife lying unconscious on the floor; he is attacked by the man who killed her, he holds him down, chokes him, and drops a worm-like parasite into his mouth. A doctor performs an autopsy on a man. We see his chest with a large incision and metal devices holding it open, and he pulls out something that had been attached to his spinal column (it looks like a worm with legs) and it is severed. The doctor performs a scan on another man's spinal cord and it has it too. A woman falls injuring her leg (we see blood on her pant leg), a snake slithers in the sand under and around her and other people shoot at it; the woman is apparently injured somehow and she dies. A man jabs a creature with a needle, draws blood, and injects himself in the arm with it (we see the insertion and blood trickles on his arm). A large explosion underground sends flames shooting through passageways. A group of dead people is seen lying on the ground, blood is everywhere. Two cabs race through traffic, one rams the other, they drive through a marketplace causing damage, one crashes, and the other rams into its side twice; the driver has a bloody face and head and the passenger jumps out. Two men fight. One of them is kicked by the other and crashes onto a window, then punches the other man in the face and slams his head on the ground. They keep fighting, and one of them before escaping crashes an object on the opponent's head, who runs after him. He then shoots the other man twice in the chest (bloody holes are seen), but the man is still alive and keeps running after him. He is shoot again, this time in a leg; the two men keep fighting, one tries to choke the other, but ends up impaled (bloody and graphic). A man hits another man in the stomach with a mallet. A woman punches another man hard in the face. Two men yell at each other, shove each other briefly and are pulled apart by other men. We hear about the mysterious disappearance of 20 children from an orphanage. Laboratory experiments having been conducted on them. Some of the characters smoke frequently. None. Alone in the Dark is a horror movie filled to the brim with frequent and extreme graphic violence and gore throughout. Almost every character in this movie is killed in very stylized and gruesome manners, mostly impalement. There are various monsters and grisly images throughout. A sudden sound might startle some viewers. A figure suddenly passes by in the foreground of a dimly lit scene. A claw-like appendage grabs a man by the head (with blood coming out from where it's pinching his skull), with another piece suddenly thrusting out through his mouth from the back of his head. A manhole type cover in a mine tunnel suddenly gives way beneath a man, sending him plummeting to his death below. A monster suddenly attacks a man, tearing off his arm. There is a brief footage of men chasing after an orphan boy through the woods and him then hiding in an electrical substation at night. We see some monsters (a cross between wolves and the creatures in ""Aliens"") in the reflection of a boy's eye. We hear the sounds of monster violence on the other side of a closed door, as a man tries to keep that door from opening. The lights in a museum flicker and then keep going on and off as a security guard slowly makes his way through the building that's filled with various large artifacts, some of which might look scary in the on and off lighting. In another part of that same museum, Edward and Aline also slowly make their way through it. A man slowly makes his way through a building as the lights flicker about him. Sand worms/snakes slither through the sand toward an injured woman. One bites her and another woman holds off another one that's surfaced, with a man and others shooting and presumably killing all of them. A lone female commando slowly makes her way through the dark, knowing monsters may be lurking anywhere. We see a massive subterranean chamber with swarms of monsters headed toward some lone survivors. They then race away, but one returns to make an explosive work to kill the creatures. We see the sudden point of view of something rapidly racing toward two survivors who turn around just as it reaches them, but the scene ends there. Many scenes are creepy and can be frightnening to children. The supernatural and monstrous creatures may scare young viewers. There is some strong language, but it's pretty sparse. 7 F-words, 12 scatological terms, 4 anatomical terms, 6 mild obscenities, 4 religious profanities, 4 religious exclamations."

Very mild. A magazine featuring bikini models is found in an old man's trunk. However he dismisses it as being a collectors edition. A young woman and young man are about to kiss but are distracted. A teenage boy and girl embrace and kiss. Very mild. When master roshi tries to catch bulma he grabs her butt and later he lets her down. Woman plays with a dragon ball in front of her cleavage. A few characters are shot in the film with blaster guns, though no blood is shown. Although not graphic or gory, Goku as Oozaru starts to strangle an incapacitated Roshi. Several teenage boys try to fight one other boy but he dodged their attacks and they hit each other instead. Two identical women fight, as one has copied the appearance of the other. A man interrupts and knocks one of the woman out, and the other woman runs away. The climactic fight between two fighters involved some fired projectiles and punches and kicks. Fairly brief and no blood. A ape looking creature attacks several people and kills a man, but no blood or gore. There is some mild bloodshed shown in a few of the fights. There is a scene where a house falls on someone, killing them. We see the corpse. Not in detail though. Goku fights and kill scary creatures, throws their bodies in lava, and race across the bodies to get to the other side. Since they're monstrous creatures, their blood and tissue is green and inhuman. None of the martial arts fight scenes are very graphic or violent. There is a scene where we see a few teens drinking what is implied to be alcohol at a party. We see a character smoking a pipe in one brief scene. The opening monologue mentions a time in the past of great destruction and death. A village is shown destroyed and a woman hunts another woman and young girl. This is quite disturbing. The main character sees visions of the future that include destruction and scary images. An ape looking monster is meant o be scary and is quite destructive. There fighting throughout is sometimes intense. 'H*ll' is said a few times. 'D*mn' is said a few times. 'Sh*t' is said once.

A non-explicit sex scene in which characters faces are shown with orgasmic expressions. A woman shows off her chastity belt. Women wear suggestive/revealing outfits and a nearly nude scene of a woman ""wearing"" only a few vegetables. A man's buttocks are shown. Several scenes in which the camera zooms on a woman's crotch to show a pixelated (censored) area. In a scene a man presses a woman's breast for a few seconds,to recognize her. Some fights/violence which is mostly comical though includes a decapitation and impalements on swords and spears. But no blood is seen. A man is shown with a small wound on his face from which blood squirts out of. While dancing, a man's neck snaps but it is shown briefly. A very fake-looking penguin starts beating up (also fake-looking) a man. People are seen drinking alcohol. There is no smoking in this film. The scene at the beginning where a penguin fart's and poops on Leonidas's face is quite gross. A woman has a huge arm, because of an ""infection,"" a man stabs a sword on it and it explodes into ooze, like pimples and zits. Cringy Scene.

A man and a woman talk in detail about the differences between the male and female sex organs and debate which is the ultimate sex organ. A woman kisses a man, pinches his nipple, invites him to perform cunnilingus on her, they kiss, he lies on top of her, and then she rolls him over and climbs on top of him; she takes his shirt off, they kiss and she thrusts her hips rhythmically. A man takes off his shirt and flexes in front of a mirror, and a man takes off his robe and stretches in front of a woman. There is a painting of a woman in a bathing suit (cleavage is evident). When Larry tells his mom that Ricki is a lesbian, his mom says she can tell Ricki has been with guys before. She then adds that she (the mom) used to be quite experimental in her youth. When wanting to speak to Ricki, Louis tells Larry, ""Put the clam-licker on."" A drawing of a woman shows cleavage. Ricki and Larry discuss sex explicitly, while she does yoga in a revealing outfit. Ricki and Larry have sex, with her on top. A man takes a gun another man was wearing and waves it around as he discusses an issue. He then shoots that other man in the forehead, killing him (with bloody results as we see blood run down the dead man's face from the hole as well as blood splatter on the front of an aquarium and some sort of bloody human tissue floating in the aquarium that a fish eats). A man goes to cut off a corpse's thumb in a morgue (to be used in place of another man). We see him starting to saw at the thumb with a scalpel and then hear the rest of the sawing sound (there's no blood). A woman takes a large kitchen knife and slits her wrists (seen), with resultant blood flow. Everyone around her panics and sends her to the hospital where she disappears from the story. This scene could be unwatchable for some viewers. A man threatens to put a gagged man through a spin in an industrial clothes dryer (to make him talk, and he's already in it). Only 2 strong graphic images (bloody)  The characters seem to get angry and yell with no real resolution to them; probably 'cuz of how poor the film is - ridiculed with plot holes. We see an intest scene where a woman slits her wrists and dissapears in the story. Various characters have varying degrees of bad attitudes, including one who murders another and others who kidnap an autistic young man (some of whom use disparaging terms about his condition). A woman attempts to commit suicide by slitting her wrists (seen with blood) while a person cuts off a corpse's thumb (no blood, but potentially disturbing). The scene where the man gets shot in the head is pretty disturbing, largely due to the fact that it's unexpected. It occurs late in the film, which up to that point has been fairly light and comical. A song has at least 1 use of the ""f"" word in it. Severe language! 124 F-words and its derivatives, 13 sexual references, 18 scatological terms, 20 anatomical terms, 5 mild obscenities, 1 religious profanity, 11 religious exclamations, 2 derogatory term for the mentally challenged, 5 derogatory terms for homosexuals."

There is a cat with human breasts. this may look real, but they are in fact belonging to tom Ashford Russell. Extreme scenes of gore and violence, such as scenes of decapitation. Someone gets slapped. Their is a flashback scene in which the main male lead gets circumcised, though the scene is cast in shadows, so it is not as graphic as it could have been, though it is still very disturbing. Characters are shown being executed, via decapitation throughout the film, but there is no gore. The final battle does reference Naziism The villain attacks an old man at one point. Frequent and copious hard drug use and references. Milk is served at this bar that a character owns and its treated as it were alcohol. Due to this film's animation style some characters might look creepy to some viewers. The scene with the boobs will give you nightmares. 2 planes crash into each other in the sky. A burning human hand is seen falling right out of the sky. This is the most shocking scene in the film One character's plane crashes into a house. One use of 'arse' Many Racial slurs throughout Many sexual innuendoes are used throughout. Crude and explicit jokes are used throughout.

No nudity. Several bloody scenes, but overall not as violent as the first or third entries. Several shark attacks show graphic blood and gore, but most of it looks fake. A man's arm is bitten off at the start before he is repeatedly attacked further. A woman is attacked by a shark while swimming, however this is revealed to be a nightmare. A shark attacks a woman on a yellow plastic boat, narrowly missing a child. A man is taken by the shark from the edge of a boat and violently dragged under water. A few people are eaten and these scenes are bloody. However, this film has the lowest body count in the series. Very brief. Several scenes are supposed to be frightening but most of the time the film is so bad and the shark looks so fake its unintentionally funny. Some strong profanity including shit, SOB, bastard. Milder profanities include hell, damn. References to deity, God, Christ and Jesus.

One minor comic sex scene involving two characters eat corn on the cob out of each others mouth and popcorn starts popping (by ""magic""). A few shots of a topless woman, although her body has been turned into vegetable matter so it's debatable whether this counts as nudity. A boy, after talking to the ghost of his grandpa, climbs on the table and pees on the food. The father takes him to his room, slams him on the bed, and tells him they will all starve now because of what he did. The father then tells the boy he will now have to suffer through ""hunger"" pains. In a dream sequence, an alien like creature bursts out of a child's stomach and makes a hissing sound. A man running through some woods falls over, green liquid is seen coming from the top of his head and pouring over his face. A boy has a nightmare where is is sitting in the back of a car and green liquid starts to pour down his face, he looks at his hands which have branches growing from wounds at the end of his fingers, he then looks at his stomach where there is a large hole and a couple of branches start to poke out. All the blood in this scene is coloured green and isn't that graphic. A Goblin throws a spear into a young man's shoulder, a woman removes it. A bit of blood is seen but not much. The young man scream loudly and annoying. A girl punches her boyfriend in the face and knocks him over. Drew finds his friend Arnold turning into a tree, he removes a piece of vegetation covering Arnold's mouth, after doing so there is a shot of green blood spurting from Arnold's nose and mouth. A man is set on fire and is seen burning alive. A Goblin is thrown down a flight of stairs, another Goblin attacks and that is also thrown down the stairs. Joshua kicks a Goblin in the nuts, Grandpa Seth then punches one. A character asks his teenage daughter if she's been ""smoking dope again"" *very mild spoilers follow* There are some scenes that can be gross and creepy, but most of the movie's just laughably terrible, badly acted, terribly written and with bad special effects. But no matter how horrendous this movie is, it's also really entertaining to watch and laugh at. One use of ""hell""; one use of ""oh my god""; two uses of ""damn"". Three uses of ""shit"" and a few uses of ""ass""."

A woman agrees to take her little brother to the mall where a loud jolt shakes the ground and people scream; the woman is left hugging her little brother's empty clothing and panics, gasping and running as other people all around her cry and run, looking for lost loved ones; we see that all the children and many adults have vanished, leaving their clothing, jewelry and any possessions they carried while men begin looting the clothing for money and the stores for TVs; a driverless car crashes loudly through large windows and into the food court, stopping amid a pile of broken glass and we see a woman's arm hanging out the passenger window; in the parking lot, a single engine plane without a pilot crashes onto the pavement and slides into a car; no one appears hurt, but we hear a loud BOOM and see flames engulfing the plane. Two men accost a woman and they all struggle over her purse while a man is blown through a loudly shattering glass door by a shotgun blast and falling on his back to the sidewalk, dead and with blood on his jacket; a man walks out and points the shotgun at a woman who raises her hands over her head and then walks away; along another street, people sit, crying and holding possessions left by vanished loved ones while two women cry over empty baby buggies and one woman cries over an empty baby romper in her hands. A motorcyclist grabs a purse from a walking woman's shoulder and a completely empty school bus rolls off a bridge overhead into a creek a few yards away (no one is hurt). A traffic jam blocks a street outside a mall and we see that many of the cars are completely empty; a woman driver cries, a man leans out of his pickup truck and shouts for everyone to move their cars out of his way and two EMT vehicles cross in the background with sirens sounding. A woman uses a metal sign stand to shatter the glass of a side door entrance to a hospital and she crawls through the glass on the floor gingerly (no blood); she finds the nursery completely empty of babies and a nurse's uniform crumpled on the floor as a woman with swollen red eyes yanks open a curtain and walks out to the first woman, stating that the babies and nurses all vanished. On an airliner, a woman pulls a handgun, points it at people, cries and screams several times that her ex-husband paid everyone to take her missing daughter, that someone put something in her drink to knock her out so the girl could be taken off the plane; other people scream and hide behind seats and the woman points the gun at her own chest but does not pull the trigger, as a reporter takes the gun and a man says that his sick mother died when he was a child and that he arrived home and found her dead, leaving him as upset as the gun-toting woman is now. A sad woman climbs to the top of a bridge at dusk, talks to her vanished mother and leans forward to jump to her death but stops when her cell phone rings and a male friend is on the line; she speaks with him and her father, whom she thought was dead, and climbs down to safety. A woman uses a truck, a pavement-rolling machine and a pickup truck to clear a makeshift runway and pours a can of gasoline at the end of the road lighting it up as a beacon for an airplane to land; the plane shakes and jolts as it glides down and lands hard, with massive sparks, screeching and red-hot wheels before stopping a few feet from a fuel tank truck, while a chemical station halfway back down the road ignites in large flames; a flight attendant puts out an inflated rubber exit ramp and helps people slide to the ground while a man kicks a person down the ramp when the person hesitates (no one is injured). Two people argue several times about how many gods there are; one person rifles the other man's flight bag, the man grabs it back, takes a toothbrush and points it shouting that he has no weapons. A woman argues with another woman who was berating a reporter in an airport terminal about Bible prophecy coming true. A woman's mother warns her that earthquakes are fulfilling Biblical prophecy; the daughter is cynical about God and stomps out of the house. A wooden sign on a street reads, ""The end is HERE."" In a church a woman finds the pastor left behind alone and she argues with him about God; he says that the vanished people went to Heaven for protection against seven years of evil and she screams at him and stomps out. A man and a woman argue about the existence of God and the man says he can no longer think of having a relationship with the woman; she becomes angry and stalks away. A hospital is overrun with new patients; we see no blood except a scratch on a man's forehead, but many people lie on gurneys and one man is holding his arm and grimacing. A woman walks home and finds it empty; she picks up a ball bat and looks around, screaming as the phone rings and she hears a recorded message when she answers it; the woman's mother and little brother have vanished and when she checks voicemail on her mother's phone she hears her pilot dad sending a Mayday signal, followed by some muffled crashing noises (she gasps, thinking he is dead) and she finds the shower running in the bathroom with her mother's jewelry lying under the spray. A man rifles through a vanished flight attendant's bag, tossing things to the floor until he breaks down crying when he sees a watch engraved with ""John 3:16"" and the words ""Bible Study!!!"" on a calendar page. All children and 1/3 of adults on a commercial airliner disappear, leaving their clothing folded in their seats and jewelry lying on top of their garments; some remaining passengers cry, others argue about what is happening and a man becomes angry whenever anyone looks at him, asking if they want to insult his size while a pilot instructs the passengers to remain seated and speaks loudly to an unruly man; several other men stand and pound on the cockpit door, but seat themselves after the pilot berates them to sit down and buckle up. A woman pulls out a baggie of crystal meth in a airplane bathroom. A woman on a plane shakes and shivers in her seat and runs to the bathroom where she looks into the mirror and says, ""It's a bad trip. You've had them before"" (referring to drug use.) A reporter sees injection track marks on a woman's arm. A bottle of wine is shown in a corner of a kitchen counter in a house. A flight attendant carries a bottle of champagne to the service area in the front of a plane. An airline passenger calls for a Scotch that we never see. Destruction images. When the Rapture occurs, people disappear, causing general panic. There's a minor plane collision and an intense, forced plane landing, with lots of fire. Viewers hear a story of a woman and children who died in a flood. Chloe says the ""s"" word, under her breath in a scene near the end (steamroller). It's very hard to make out, and not in the subtitles."

The scene cuts away and we don't see them strip A man flies off a golf cart and lands on a man, crushing him.

One set says that as she was coming out of her mom, she kicked her twin inside her mom. Jill refers to the movie Pretty Woman, and says ""the one where she's a hooker"" Women on a cruise ship wear skimpy bikinis. Elsewhere we see very low-cut dresses and other revealing tops. A woman at a New Year's Eve party reports, ""I'm not wearing any underwear."" Another woman announces that she works at Hooters, as she grabs her clothed chest. Jill makes comments about two ""hookers"" at a party. And at Felipe's picnic, she dances and shakes her clothed breasts. An old man in the crowd grabs her backside. Another guy manages to look up her skirt, reporting to his friend, ""It's not a guy."" When thinking about a good user name for a dating site, Jill says, ""How about Manilow? 'Cause he can use me anytime."" Later, after Jill fails to receive any responses on the site, Jack secretly posts a sexual innuendo-laden ad on Craigslist to stir up lots of responses for her. But Jill balks at Jack's suggestion that she date Al Pacino, saying, ""All he wants to do is play Twister with your sister!"" Pacino smirks over the phone, ""I can smell horny across an ocean!"" In desperation, Jack scrambles into a public bathroom and dresses up as his sister to have a date with Pacino. He fills her bra with two cantaloupes, and when he steps out of the stall, the bathroom attendant motions him over and adjusts his melons so they look right. Later, Jill is standing in the hallway and the bathroom attendant spots her and mistakenly gives her another adjustment. Jill immediately punches the attendant back through the bathroom door. An inebriated Jack punches Pacino in the face, and Pacino returns the favor, breaking a chair across Jack's back. A drunken woman puts Erin in a headlock and starts swinging her around. Jill steps in, throwing the woman into a wall and punching her in the face. While staying with Jack's family, Jill wants to go with them to a number of fun activitiesand the results are almost always disastrous. When the kids ride on ponies, Jill insists that she's not too heavy to join them and crushes the pony flat. Then they visit The Price Is Right and Jill knocks herself out with the big prize wheel. She rides the family's Sea-Doo in the pool and flies up out of the water, crashing down on the lawn furniture. At Thanksgiving dinner, talk turns to the sometimes physical connection between twins. Jill starts slapping herself in the face to see if Jack can feel it. He says he can't, so Gary slugs her on the jaw and knocks her backward off her chair. ""Did you feel that, Daddy?"" the kid gleefully asks. At the picnic, Felipe's bug-eyed grandma gets pummeled repeatedly as Jill's shoe flies off and conks her, and a swinging broom handle knocks her out cold. People (and the cockatoo) are seen drinking bottled beer, mixed drinks and/or Jack Daniel's on a cruise ship. Wine and spirits show up at a party and several dinners. Jack (pretending to be Jill) slugs back quite a lot of the hard stuff on his ""date"" with Al.  1 use of ""Crap"" and 1 use of ""Damn"" Two uses of hell and God's name is inappropriately interjected more than a dozen times. Name-calling includes freak, weirdo, psycho, annoying, loser, stupid and rat face."

There is no cursing but there is lots of mild language throughout the movie (Deleted. Personal opinions about ratings are not appropriate for the Parents Guide.)"

A young man and a young woman sit on a bed, they kiss, he stops her, she climbs out of bed and removes her nightgown (she is wearing a black bra and panties, and both have flashing lights strategically placed over her nipples and pubic area) and she says, ""I want to go all the way."" A young man removes his shirt and pants (his crotch is blocked by the crowd and then a large disco ball when the camera moves in closer) and turns to show his back and we see his bare buttocks when he bends over. Four men wearing cutoff jeans and no shirts dance together and make suggestive moves toward each other. (This is rather comical) A man has an inflatable doll wearing a bikini. A young man is shown with a noticeable bulge in his pants, grabs it as he walks into a high school lunchroom, and a young woman appears impressed. Some sexually related dialogue in a few scenes. At the very end, Edward's naked rear is shown in a close-up filling the entire screen A girl beats up several other girls in a fountain. A teenage boy punches a teenage girl in the face by way of greeting A girl threatens another girl with a knife A vampire is seen biting a girl's neck in his profile picture All violence is exaggerated for comical effect: A young man is struck in the head with a baseball bat, his head separates from his body and crashes through a car window (we see the severed head with blood at the neck). Four men attack a vampire and pull his limbs off and then his head and throw it into the woods (we see the bloody stumps and tissue at the tear site). A young man is hit in the head with a book and his head is ripped off. A vampire bites a woman on the neck and blood sprays from the wound while the woman screams (a young woman in a passing car sees the attack). A vampire squirrel bites a vampire on the neck. A vampire sucks the blood from a young woman's arm (we see her shrivel but is then OK). A car skids toward a young woman, a young man leaps to her aid and slams another young man into the side of the car stopping it before it hits her; the young man is shown with a twisted neck and bones protruding, a broken arm with a bone sticking through the skin and blood at the tear (we see him later in a cast, neck and head brace). A young woman has a bloody finger after cutting herself on paper; blood spurts from the wound, she is thrown into a wall by a young man and we see that she has broken her arm and a bone is poking through the skin along with more spurting blood, which she pours into numerous champagne glasses from which two men drink. Three vampires attack a young woman and one bites her in the arm (we later see tooth marks and the vampire's teeth have actually remained attached to her arm). A young man shoots a young woman and she falls into a hole in the ground; the young man then throws a cell phone that hits the young woman in the head as she is trying to climb out of the hole (no blood is shown). A young woman is struck hard in the face with a shovel and falls to the ground, several other girls with sledge hammers, shovels and planks of wood fight and one is stabbed in the stomach with a pitchfork (we hear a crunch but no blood is evident). A young man is struck in the head with a bat covered with spikes and we see him lying on the ground with it sticking out of the side of his head (he's OK). A man punches another man in a wheelchair, who then kicks the other man in the face, and they fight: one is slammed onto the street, the other is pounded on with the wheelchair and they both end up with bloody, bruised, scratched faces and one man has several teeth broken off. A man punches another man in the nose, then in the jaw, and pinches his nipples (the man screams and we see his nose twisted out of shape). A young woman maces her father (we see his reddened eyes), she kicks him in the crotch and rips off his mustache (we see a bloody spot where his mustache used to be and he collapses onto the ground). A young man throws a young woman through the ceiling and she crashes back down through the roof; a satellite dish falls on her and then a pile of bricks (we see her lying on the floor and screaming). A young man juggles a baby, a bowling ball and an apple and we hear a thud when the bowling ball lands on top of the baby (we do not see the child injured). a vampire bites a human to drink her blood then she falls dead. A father leaves a note for his daughter that reads, ""The weed is in the top drawer."" A vampire drinks from a bottle of blood, a man guzzles beer from a tube. A young woman talks about ""binge drinking"" in a positive light. A man drinks wine. A young woman drinks from a bottle of champagne. None; comical violence. Vampires. A ""special edition Feel-Real dolly"" is shown in the unrated version, along with the mention that it is warmed up in the tub so it's not as creepy. A girl asks a rhetorical sexual question. At least 1 F-word, 1 obscene hand gesture, 6 sexual references, 14 scatological terms, 6 anatomical terms, 8 mild obscenities, 1 religious profanity, 5 religious exclamations. The Unrated version has more swearing in it, akin to the other unrated versions of Seltzerberg movies (eg, Disaster Movie). Name-calling (virgin, loser, lesbian, Canadians, evil blood sucker.)"

The President ""Snowballs"" says that everyone wants to see a lesbian love story and a group of college girls appear in the arena dancing eroticly. Their nipples then grow large In one of the help canisters that is recieved there is a long collection of multi-coloured condoms. There are also a number of other crude jokes made throughout the movie. 5/10 Some people in District 12 are shown eating their hands, with mustard, BCC sauce etc. When Kantmiss gives the ""Chicken pin"" to her sister, the pin accidentally stabs through her hand. Kantmiss' mouth bleeds extremely after she bit a gag bread. A young woman kicks a young man's butt hard. A man gives another man a wedgie while he is wearing a thong. His thong splits him in half. A woman is killed when an acne crème bottle is stabbed in her neck. A long bread is shot in a character's eye. A boy's back is seen seriously injured. Very disgusting to see. A young man holds a little girl and kicks her like a football in a tree, and she dies later. The Marvel characters blow up, as does the band LMFAO by stepping off the platforms too soon. There are many other ways the players are killed, usually with a bit of gore. 1/10 A man is seen drinking and throws the bottle. 2/10 None really. A boy's back is seen seriously injured and can be very disgusting to see. An official salute is the middle finger, and it's shown a few times.

One character announces a name that says ""Hugh Janus."" (sounds like huge anus) Not really profanity, though. Mostly, there's very strong language for a movie that's PG-13. 1 uncensored use of ""f*ck."" ""F*ck"" and ""sh""t"" are bleeped out multiple times during Stanley Ceasarman's show. ""Goddamn"" can be heard a few times. Some innuendo can be heard at times. Bob Hylox calls his sidekick, Cleaver Williams, his ""color"" commentator.

The drawn-out sequence features jokes about Charlie's bedroom full of recording equipment and his wall full of sex tapes. From there, the scene is sped up to lots of cartoonish sexual acrobatics though fully clothed. A short scene during the Hoover part where one of the Harry Hoovers has its nozzles going in between a dog's back legs so that the dog's penis is inside the tube and the Hoover is on ""suck mode""; the dog whines with pleasure. Video recordings show Jody getting ""sexually"" involved with everything from a houseplant to a microwave oven. She wears a variety of cleavage-baring, tight-fitting outfits.

Kendra seductively runs her fingers in and around Jody's mouth, then the camera focuses on Jody's face while Kendra pleasures her. Crude drawings of penises are briefly shown. Kendra pole dances, licks the pole, and shakes her rear end. When looking online for info about the ""book of evil,"" Jody keeps ending up on a porn site featuring scantily clad women. The book Fifty Shades of Grey appears in a dream sequence involving whips, sex toys and bondage gear. One of the young girls finds a vibrator and a box of sex toys. Dan drops lots of penis jokes. They're joined by visual and/or verbal gags about bestiality, rape, pedophilia, child and animal molestation, homosexuality, incest, anal sex, oral sex, girls with giant breasts, guys with giant breasts, masturbation, auto-fellatio, copulating dogs, STDs and prostitution. The group of possessed Christians cut themselves and one another with blades and power tools. One woman slices her tongue in two, another hacks off her own arm, and a guy saws off his leg, etc. (We see screaming faces and spurting, splashing gore.) An armless, legless man reports that his genitals are in the corner. Dan is the victim of many, many thumps and spills. He's kicked in the crotch, falls off tables, smashes through a window, is severely shocked and gets banged on the head with everything from a power box to a rack full of frying pans. Others get poked in the backside and bitten on the leg. When the wandering rappers first come upon the cabin housing the feral girls, they pull out their guns and start shooting at everything that moves. Dan and Maria get into a brawl in the front yard, punching and kicking each other, and lashing out with yard ornaments. A group of female reality TV stars also go at it.

His blood splatters on another man's face. A shot of the room, coated in blood, is shown. It is only blood, no gore. The room is tinted in a blue light, so the blood is dark. The blood is shown close up in a later scene, with slightly better lighting, making the red more obvious. Black and white, grainy video footage is later shown with the explosion in full, though it is very fast and blood obscures the screen. A woman's head is grabbed and smashed against a metal wall several times. No blood. Her body is found later, face cut up, laying in blood and viscera. The shot is short. A man has what is presumably blood dripping from his mouth, coating his chin, and his ears. The lighting is red, making the liquid appear almost black. A man has his throat bitten out by another man. Lot of blood, though the scene is short. The camera does come back to him after a minute or so, showing his neck with gashes and thick blood that obscures the wounds. A man is shot repeatedly in the chest. His body jerks often, making the impact wounds hard to see. Very little blood. A man is shot several times. The camera goes from a side view to his back, a some splatter is shown exiting the body. A woman tackles a man and proceeds to choke him. A man punches through another man. His bloody fist emerges from the other's back. A man and woman are shot in quick succession. Some quick splatter, scenes pass quickly. A crowd rushes a small group by funneling through a doorway. The group has guns and opens fire. Blood is shown, but the scene isn't lengthy. A flame thrower is used against a crowd. The fire is obviously computer animated, and no one is visibly burned before the scene shifts. A woman is shot in the head in a very fast scene done in red light and heavy fog. There's a flash of spatter but nothing is really visible. Guns that fire red lasers are used against a crowd of people. This is extremely effective. The camera has several close up shots of severed body parts, including the clean cuts. A man is eaten alive by members of a converging crowd. He screams. No gore shown. A man is splashed with a corrosive chemical. It begins to eat away small circles out of his face before the camera switches to showing his body collapsing inside his undamaged jumpsuit. No screaming. A cornered man detonates an explosive. The screen goes dark. The aftermath is shown briefly, with some gore. The seen is smoky, obscuring much. A modified flamethrower is used on people, reducing them to puddles. No actual injuries shown. A woman is attacked. She shots her attacker, hits them with her gun, shoots again, then shoots a different attacker. Very fast, very little blood. Many characters drink, often excessively, during the film. Moonshine is being brewed aboard the ship. Actual brewing is not shown, but the result is drunk by characters.

A young couple cuddle in the sea water half naked. No sex scenes, but there are some sexual references. A severed arm is shown. A man is eaten with little blood shown. A girl is cut with blood streaming down. A dead corpse is seen in a window. We see it again in close-up and another shot shows his arm already been bitten off. A main character falls into the shark's mouth, he survives however, and we see him struggling to escape. He is then eaten slowly, his grunts and moans as he dies can be disturbing. A fair about of crunching is heard as well, and a lot of blood flows into the water. A man is grabbed by the shark and violently bitten in half. The film has a body count about the same as the first Jaws but is more graphic and arguably the goriest in the series. The first night Mike, Sean and Kathryn meet Kelly, they are drinking whiskey or wine etc. Violent, but not as bad as the original. There is one part of the movie where somebody pulls the sheet off of an extremely decomposed body; we can see the face up close. This part can be extremely terrifying for everyone. One of the most can be or even the bloodiest delivery in the Jaws series. Some images are disturbing to many people and for a sensitive audience. In addition to large doses of suspense and tension. Suspense and terror throughout the film. One use of Bitch 20 hells, 4 asses. A couple uses of shit and damn.

A man has a strange trap put on his head to trap in the bees they pour in which go mad and sting him repeatedly, leaving many marks on him. A man in a bear costume hits a woman in the face. A man pulls a gun on an advancing mob, but the gun is unloaded. None The plotline is how a man tries to find his ex-fiancee's daughter. Some frightening images include multiple scenes with dead bodies, a bloody tarp carried by two men (we never see what is in the tarp), and a graphic visual of a character's legs being broken with the character screaming in pain. The character is then hauled by his broken legs into a large wooden craft, and burned alive. There is a gory scene in which the man finds a dead man with his eyes removed (blood is in his sockets and on his face), his mouth sewn shut (with more blood) and his hands removed and in their place are twigs. 2 F-words (non-sexual), 3 uses of s(cat) and other mild profanities.

Spooner and Sean are partying with two young women. The women are dancing around in their bikini tops. When Dan says he has something on his Doppler (radar), Stevie jokes that it sounds kinky. Nick and Elizabeth embracing and making out in the shower. Some are through the frosted shower stall doors where we can see the shape of their bodies together, but no details. Others include close-up views of their mouths kissing, hands running down non-explicit skin and then a head and shoulders shot of them kissing and him nuzzling her neck. We never see any explicit nudity or any actual sex, but the scene is highly sensual. Elizabeth is in a top that shows cleavage and she's wearing small panties (but not a thong). Several brief shots of Stevie in her shirt and panties (in bed and standing in the kitchen) where we see a lot of leg and the side of her butt. A Man catches on fire and violently burns to death A Lantern is smashed at a man's feet and he catches on fire and burns to death, in the unrated version his face is seen melting Several People Burn to death on a boat A woman tries to start up her car, but doesn't turn on, and gets hit by an on coming truck in front of her and the car flips over into the water. Glass floats in the air circling a man in the middle of it, then suddenly sharp pieces fly through his body then he dies. (no blood is shown) A few people in a boat surrounded by fog are terrorized; two women are thrown through a window (they're supposeably dead), a knife floating in the air stabs a man in the eyes (it is dark that you can only see dark figures, no blood is shown), then the last man screams in horror (the screen ends that we don't see what happens). Little, if any. When they are in the hospital/morgue area, one of the dead bodies sits up and gets off the bed. His eyes are sewn shut.

A boy in a wheelchair rolls down a hill, falls off a cliff and lands in a lake (he appears to be okay afterwards, but this could still frighten some viewers). There is also an eerie build up of the boy rolling nearer to the brow of the hill. It was the alien's whistling that intruiged him, leading to the loss of control when he started to lean forwards and gravity took over. A man says m*****k , b*tt , f*rt Bir**d*y

One man is engulfed in flames when a fireball hits him. Some dragons of apparently different hue chase and fight each other. One dragon is shot with a huge arrow and drops down, eventually being impaled on the spiral of a minaret. A dragon gobbles up a man whole (the scene is quick, dark and murky so not much is evident). Another dragon is killed when a gate with pointy thingies at the bottom comes down hard on him; his blood oozes copiously, flowing down several steps. There are several fights, most involving fists and kicks, and a few with swords, torches and sticks. A man slashes at another man with a small knife, a man stabs a man in the foot, and a man is stabbed from behind and killed (after being punched several times; at one point his arm is twisted and we hear bones cracking). A man has a sword driven vertically into his chest and twisted several times as a form of torture. A man breaks another man's neck. A man scratches a girls' chest with one of his long nails; a little blood comes out of the small incision. A girl stabs a couple of men with two knives and a man attacks with a huge ax (the scenes are not graphic or gory). A man is stabbed and thrown off a tall building. A brawl breaks out in a tavern, with a lot of people running around hitting each other. A man falls into what looks like quicksand, and a man's facial skin ripples as if something's moving underneath (after this experience, there are red, somewhat enlarged veins evident around the man's ears). Several men get bruised after fights, there's a lot of property destruction (primarily dragon related) and some threatening by crossbows.  There are several dark, dank and spooky dungeons, and many dragons. A man goes through a maze and is confronted and almost done in by shooting flames, huge pendulums and rotating blades. We see several skeletons, one of whom can talk. Two reptilian-looking tentacles come out of a man's ears, writhe around menacingly and go back inside his head. In another scene, the tentacles come out and grab a girl by the ears. She proceeds to scream while the tentacles apparently transmit her thoughts to their owner.

Shark Boy puts his arm around Lava Girl, and his arm sizzles and he pulls it away. Max's mom wears a low-cut top that reveals cleavage. Linus refers to Lavagirl as ""hot."" Lava Girl's leg pops off at the knee, she goes back for it and she sticks it back on (the leg does not seem to be artificial, but the reality where everything takes place is). Lava Girl melts into a puddle (she comes back to her normal form later). Lava Girl's feet are frozen into ice cubes. Lava Girl's head spins completely around and we hear a squish and a creak. Lava Girl touches Shark Boy on the arm and he sizzles. A character falls into water and is attacked by many sharks (we see him thrashing, but no blood or anything else; it's not clear if he survives or not). Brains fall from the sky and splat on the ground (we hear squishes and spurts when they hit). Brain matter also splatters on the screen. Linus' head inflates and he topples over. Sharkboy is zapped repeatedly by electric eels swimming beneath his feet, he is also chased by many electric eels in the water, he tries to swim away, they continue to zap him, and he sinks to the bottom motionless; Max touches the water and is shocked, and Lavagirl dives into the eel infested water and pulls Shark Boy to the surface. Max is zapped on the backside by an electric bolt. Sharkboy, Lavagirl and Max are locked in a cage. Sharkboy becomes very angry and his teeth become pointed (like a shark's teeth), and he uses them to tear apart the cage to free them. Max throws a journal at Linus hitting him in the head. Bullies throw paper balls at Max. Linus and his friends chase Max through the playground trying to get his dream journal, Max climbs up a rope ladder, he slips and hits his crotch on a rope, and he falls back and drops his dream journal on the ground -- Linus gets it. Max and Linus fight each other: one shoots piranhas at the other, who fends them off with bubbles. A large storm swirls in the ocean toward Sharkboy (aged 5) standing on a pier, it destroys the pier, we see him in a raft while the Sharkboy's father drifts in the other direction, and Sharkboy's raft is surrounded by sharks who actually protect him; he rides on the back of one shark and is taken into a cave where we hear that he grows up and begins to develop shark gills, fins and instincts. Max's parents are sucked into a large funnel cloud, but they are retrieved and brought out of it. A large funnel cloud blows and swirls toward a school building, the windows are blown out, and the children in a classroom fall to the floor under their desks. Sharkboy throws Lavagirl into a volcano, and she emerges shooting lava from her hands. A narrow walkway begins to melt under Lavagirl's feet, she sneezes, blowing Sharkboy back (he nearly falls off the walkway), and they rush across and get to the other side just as the walkway falls away. Max and Linus ride rock pillars that shoot up into the air, a rope bridge joins them, they walk out onto the bridge and it breaks; one catches the other as they fall, and they soar on wooden planks that spin like helicopters. Max climbs a tall ice column, he retrieves an ice crystal, he drops it to Lavagirl who catches it and she is turned into ice, and they are surrounded by guards. Lavagirl shoots a stream of lava at Sharkboy's backside. A girl freezes a character, who explodes into many snowflakes. Lavagirl is wrapped up in cables and shocked, a boy fights them with punches and kicks, then with a stick, and two cables surround the boy and zap him. Electric cords writhe like snakes, and Sharkboy and Lavagirl fight with several of them. Many creatures charge toward Sharkboy, Lavagirl and Max, and the children ride on a vehicle that shoots fudge at the creatures. None Sharkboy loses his dad in a tornado/storm at sea. There is a scene were Sharkboy goes legitimately insane by laughing bubbles. He screams as his sharp teeth shows up. Several scenes show Max having nightmares e.g.we see Max crying over Lavagirl (unconscious and soaked.) Sharkboy is zapped repeatedly by electric eels and sinks to the bottom motionless and Lavagirl dives into the eel infested water and pulls Shark Boy to the surface and then we see her straggling to breathe and falls unconscious. Mild sequences of harmless action throughout. Sharkboy calls Max ""a little bleep"". A character says, ""fudge."" Name-calling (hot head and dream-boy.)"

During a movie shoot, a woman wearing a low-cut top and short skirt (cleavage and part of her bare buttocks are visible) talks suggestively to a man, she opens her top to reveal her bare breasts, the man screeches like a monkey, thrashes, and he ejaculates (we hear splattering sounds and we see semen on a woman's sweater and a man's shoe).
A man sits in a beanbag chair, pulls down his pants (we see his bare knees and thighs) and we see his arm flailing violently while he masturbates and three other men in the same room cheer him on (one man sitting behind him also masturbates and we see movement in his pants pocket).

Two men dance suggestively around another man with hip thrusts and gesturing, and they press rubber penises against his face and mouth and he leaves. A mannequin moves and says, ""Fart in my mouth"" twice and then holds up two rubber penises as a man runs out of a store.

A young man and a young woman have sex: we see the young man thrusting, we see an outline of something squirm in her stomach, he makes a crude remark about climaxing and pulls back as the young woman appears to die (please see the Violence/Gore category for more details); a piranha is seen on the end of his genitals and we see his bare buttocks and prosthetic genitals as he chops the fish off. A woman's bare breasts are seen (covered in blood) as she holds a man's disembodied head in her hands and shakes it between her breasts. We see an ""adult pool"" where a fully nude woman (shaved genitals with visible labia are briefly but clearly visible) jumps into a pool while another topless woman is seen dancing suggestively against a pole and a fully nude woman is shown from underwater (her breasts are visible but genitals are obscured). A woman is seen facedown on a float (her bare buttocks are visible). A closeup of a woman's bare breasts and shaved crotch is seen as she steps out of a pool. We see many topless women, their bare breasts visible and multiple close-shots of women's bikini bottoms. We see a woman with bare breasts, and a nude man (his bare side is visible). We see shirtless young women in a pool (their bare breasts are visible) as they swim. We see in slow-motion young women shirtless (bare breasts are visible) in swimming pools. We see a young man's bare buttocks in a pool. A young man is seen thrusting in a pool of water, implied to be pleasuring himself on a water duct in the pool; he shouts in pleasure. A young woman tells a young man that he needs to ""make love"" to her, that she does not want to ""die a virgin"" and then makes a crude sexual remark; she takes off her pants and we see her underwear, focusing on her crotch. A young woman tells a young man that she wants to ""take off all their clothes"" and go swimming, the shadowy outline of their nude bodies is visible underwater. We see in slow-motion young women wearing bikinis walking slowly by and focusing on their buttocks. A man makes a crude remark about a young man ""boning"" a woman's stepdaughter. We see many people attacked by piranhas and men, women and children scream: we see blood covering many people, we see a piranha biting a young woman's neck and blood spouts from the wound, a man enters the water and shoots piranhas with a machine gun, and one shot hits a young man, knocking him backwards as pieces of exploding fish are seen in the water and blood fills a pool; we hear children screaming, a man rushes to help a shouting child, knocking a man over and pushing another man into the water, dead bodies are seen on the side of the pool and floating on top of the water, a man is seen missing an arm, a young man has the back half of a piranha literally sticking up his ass (headfirst, blood covers his buttocks) and another young man helps pull the piranha out of his ass as he screams (several of the above and definitely the last instance listed are played for comedy). A piranha appears to rip through a young woman's body: she seizes on a bed as a young man thrusts above her, engaged in active sex, we see blood spray as the young man pulls away from the young woman, a piranha is seen on his genitals, and the young man uses a large butcher knife to chop off his genitals (we see a spray of blood); the young woman wakes, blood is covering her and the room and she walks over to the fish, lying in a pool of blood, steps on it and it spits out the young man's genitals. This is extremely horrific and graphic. As a television reporter narrates, we see a short flashback of the ""Lake Victoria Massacre"" from the first movie. Blood fill the water of a crowded lake; young men and women struggle to climb onto a stage, leaving behind bloody handprints as some of them are dragged under the water; we see boats and swimming floats covered in blood and bloody people. A young man grabs the partially eaten body of a young woman from the water, we see blood and gore coming from her body, and she appears to have been decapitated; many bodies are seen covering the ground and floating in the water, including partially eaten bodies. We see the dead body of a young woman as a piranha snaps at her finger and swims away (the body appears covered in bite marks). A piranha leaps at two young women who angrily smash it to death causing blood to spray over them. A young woman is dragged out of the water and is unharmed except from a small bite on her ankle (we later see the cut look slightly gangrenous). A man has a flashback of himself using a boat motor to kill many piranhas; blood fills the water. A young woman swims in blood-filled water and we see disembodied limbs zoom past her, the young woman begs a young man for help and she goes underwater. Seconds before a young woman is attacked by a piranha, a young man throws a spear through its head. We see blood pooling in the water under a woman on a raft and seconds later she screams. Throughout the movie we frequently see young men and women smoking cigarettes, marijuana cigarettes, and drinking alcohol in excess. A police officer approaches a group of young men and women and he remarks that there should not be underage drinking as the officer smokes what appears to be a marijuana cigarette and drinks a beer. The piranha attacks could be quite intense and frightening to some young viewers, however, many are played for laughs, unlike the first film. The film is filled with graphic and overtly gory deaths, though there is more bodily mutilation than death. One small child is decapitated and his mother is seen screaming and crying (made more horrific by the fact that the film seems to portray this as an amusing thing). Some scenes may scare some young viewers, however there are a lot of comical scenes and this installment is less scary and less intense than the first film. About 23 fucks, 7 sexual references, 16 shits, 18 anatomical terms, 12 mild obscenities"

No nudity but humping and thrusting are clearly visible including a woman's bareback for a period of time. What's worse is that the mother doesn't do anything to stop the sex scene but the sex scene is very over the top. A stripper's breasts are shown in the first few minutes of the movie at an opening in a strip club. The nudity is shown breifly but mildy. First with her bra on and later on scenes with breasts visible. We see various bare-breasted women in a strip club where a woman does her pole dancing thing again. This time, she's even more scantly clad than before (a sheer bikini type top and small and tight shorts that show much of her bare butt) and she does various sexual moves, while also bending over, crawling on all fours, and lying on her back and spreading her legs for the patrons to see. At various points, the camera focuses close on her body parts. In biology class, a man is asked to find the female reproductive organs and the seminal receptor, but he ends up pointing out the male reproductive organs (for what turns out to be worms, which aren't seen). A teenage girl then jokingly tells him that it looks like he needs more experience with the female anatomy. The man puts his hand on her lap near the genitals. We see slow-motion views of a woman doing her striptease pole dance while scantly clad (in mini shorts that show a lot of her bare butt, almost like a thong, and a camisole type top that shows cleavage). We also see a bare-breasted woman in the same venue. Knowing a woman is checking him out, a worker removes his shirt outdoors and then suggestively holds a branch in front of him (in a somewhat phallic fashion), all as we see a close-up view of her clothed butt, representing his POV. We see a side autopsy view of a fully nude woman's dead body on a table (we see the bare breasts and part of the bare butt). Finding that one of her fingers has fallen off, a woman faints and ends up on the floor (in her revealing striptease outfit). A man rushes out to ask some male FBI agents if they have a condom or ""rubber,"" and they laugh that they don't, amused by his urgency (but this turns out to be just a diversion on his and Dakota's part). A high school man and woman is seen briefly but passionately kiss while clothed and standing. The two sleep with each other and a vision of light. We see a shirtless man with a large tattoo on his chest (that moves in an animated fashion). A cat has his genitals shown coming out of his butt. Note: it wasn't intended to be sexually but to the viewers look it is pretty disgusting. A young woman watches a man in her rear view mirror, he takes off his shirt and is bare-chested, she steps out of her car and looks at him, and she turns and walks away. A young man caresses a young woman's knee, she pushes him away, they talk about the fact that she does not want to have sex with him, and he professes his love for her. A young woman wears low-cut tops and dresses throughout the movie that reveal cleavage and bare shoulders. Young men are shown bare-chested in a few scenes, and a man removes his shirt and we see him bare-chested. A young man and a young woman (her chest is covered with a sheet and he's bare-chested) lie in bed talking, after having had sex. A young woman talks about selling her body to hairy old men with B.O. A young woman asks a young man if he ever had sex with another young woman. A young woman calls another young woman a sex addict. A young woman says that she is a hostess at a ""gentleman's club."" A young man is embarrassed when asked to identify the female sex organs of an earthworm and he mistakenly finds the male sex organs. A woman hears voices in her head and has a disturbing flashback including a briefly visible shower, two girls screaming, a severed digit and a hit in the head with a shovel and knows that she has to stop the killer. She gets out and sneaks through the porch. She goes to the basement and knocks a football plopping down the stairs. That alerts the killer so she hides in the corner hoping her won't see him. There's talk of limb amputation, and that the killer used amphetamines to keep his victim alert during his sadistic spree of amputating some of her limbs. We see a recreation of some people in a bar drinking. One is then shot in the neck and killed. At the same time, his twin in another location suddenly has blood flow from a new hole in his neck, as well as out of his mouth. We see some still photos of stigmata, including one man with blood down from both eyes. (also seen in the trailer of the movie). It is black and white. The killer digs up a young woman who is buried alive. The soil digs on the glass coffin transitioning into a flash of an owl. A teenage girl is kidnapped (not seen) and then seems in anguish while bound and gagged and having blurry views of her sadistic kidnapper. He then places a brick of dry ice onto her right hand, and we later see her fingers that are all black. He then lifts that ice that ends up pulling off some skin and meat from her hand (seen in closeup). He then uses a glass cleaver to cut off those fingers, with bloody results (including a stream running off from the scene), all as she screams and struggles in pain. After the torture, she tries grabbing on some tools with her left hand. Someone reaches through a doorway trying to grab a young woman, she pushes the door closed on the person's arm, and then begins sawing off the person's hand -- the camera lingers and it takes some time to separate while blood accumulates, and we see the blade slowly making its way through the skin and the bone; the hand plops to the floor and the person runs screaming with an exposed wrist stump. We see another view of the gloved hand going down the bloody striptease pole. We then see the woman remove that glove, with a finger falling out (we see blood on the severed digit as well as the hand). We later see a bloody towel around her hand, and then blood dripping onto the floor in a bus, with a stranger telling her she needs to get her hand above her heart to stop that. A young woman has what seems to be a nightmare about being cut and mutilated. In the nightmare, the killer wearing blue uses a glass blade to press on the woman's arm. In the hospital bed, we see a puncture wound opening in her arm, blood pools and dribbles and she wakes up and sees her arm covered with blood and she screams in panic. The blood she smears all over leaving a mess. Her father comes in the hospital room quickly A young woman tapes a severed finger onto a table, and then begins stitching it back to her hand with a needle and thread (we see the needle tugging against the skin and we hear her breathing and moaning and we see blood on the table and on the hand and finger). A young woman is bound and gagged and strapped to an operating table, someone puts a drug in her mouth, and she writhes and struggles against her restraints. -A young woman wakes up during surgery to amputate her arm and leg, she hyperventilates, and then goes back under and we hear the noise of the saw. A young woman wakes up with an amputated leg and a cast on her hand The killer wearing blue tries to stab a woman with a glass blade but she gets out and trips him. He lands on an electronic vacuum with lightening flashing against the set. The woman goes under an operating table and the man is stabbed in the gut and jabbed in the carotid artery (blood pours and spurts from his wounds), He takes one last stroll with his bloody shirt and he collapses to the floor with his mannequin legs. In another scene, we see a video of a man being shot and another man develops a similar wound that bleeds heavily. A man with a tire iron goes into a serial killers house to confront the killer and does not come out; a young woman goes looking for him and finds blood trickling down onto a blood bucket. She sees him wrapped in plastic mortally wounded on an operating table soaked with blood. He tells her his final words and died. We also see a severed hand in a bowl of ice with clothes and gloves on the floor. The man with the severed hand plays the piano and in the stair cellar there is a glass blade full of blood (implied it was used to torture someone else). A young woman falls off a chair and to the floor and we see her with a bloody nose to drip down her chin. A young woman has a dream about a young man taking off his shirt and revealing a tattoo of a heart with wings, and the wings begin to move, and then slashes appear across his chest (no blood is evident). We see parents of a young woman identifying her body in a morgue and they scream and cry in disbelief (we see her on the table covered with a sheet and her face is tinged blue). A young woman pounds on an apartment door, opens it, recoils from the smell and finds a woman dead in a chair (we see the woman's blue-tinged face and arms). She has been known to be dead of drug overdose and she is identified as a crackhead. (Flies are feeding from the corpse). A woman tries to get a trophy at a house. An image appears on the mirror of a tortured girl with a white dress and a killer holding a shovel smacking her in the face. Her twin also gets the identical motion falling on the carpet with blood on her nose dripping to her chin. The killer drags her, then an owl appears. Rose thorns of blue land on a stream. A killer kisses prosthetic legs that hang from a ceiling, and then caresses a young woman's hair with a sharp knife. He says that she should be dead by now. A young woman fights with someone who is trying to kill her, the killer grabs her arm (it is prosthetic), and he rips the prosthetic out and knocks her with the prosthetic arm. We hear a loud scream and a slashing sound while looking at a black screen. She gets tied up. A woman nearly crashes on a dog when she swerves to miss an animal in the road and discovers a badly injured (dismembered) person in a ditch on the side of the road (not much is visible in the dark) but she does comfort the woman. A stump of gore is seen on the woman's arm A man describes the wounds a young woman suffered while writing an autopsy report (limbs and digits had been removed). We hear that a young woman's body was found after she had been missing. A young woman argues with police on information about the person who kidnapped and tortured her. A young woman is frightened while walking alone on a dark road when she sees a figure watching her from a distance. We see someone closing a casket lid and digging a grave. Two young girls hold their hands as if they are injured and scream. A young woman has trouble breathing and feels like she is suffocating when she is having a panic attack in the car. A young woman separates from her friends, walks into a crowd looking for someone and does not return to a previously arranged meeting place. A possum eats something (we hear slurping and crunching), and a young woman pricks her finger on the thorn of a rose. Catching a teenage girl smoking in her room, a woman takes the cigarette and says it's a non-smoking house, but takes a drag before putting it out. We see cigarette butts in an ashtray. A young woman takes a pill and drinks from a bottle of alcohol. A man drinks alcohol in a few scenes, and people are shown smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol in several exotic dance club scenes. A young woman smokes cigarettes in several scenes, and a woman smokes cigarettes in several scenes. A young woman says that her mother died from a drug overdose and a young woman talks about being raised by a crack addict. Some underage smoking and alcohol use. A dismembered teenage girl is seen in the side of the road limbless. An operating room sequence occurs. Tissues of blood is everywhere. A woman has nightmares, the deaths are bloody. A woman finds a body on a table under a sheet of plastic. It appears dead, but the person is alive, albeit only for a moment (and may be lying in blood on the table). We hear the sound of a woman being tortured, followed by a loud thump (presumably a fatal blow). Torture warning: The movie contains one gross scene of torture and dismemberment. The impact of torture is shown fully and briefly R for grisly images and torture, sex and nudity The torture scenes are very gross and tense to many viewers, seeing as how you see literally everything. The killer leaves the dry ice on the girl's hand and tears the skin apart. The killer cuts the hand and pours the blue liquid while the victim screams in pain. Bloody dismemberments involving limbs are seen overall. Fingers are cut off and falls. The extremities are torn off leaving bloody mess.

In an early scene one of the main characters offers many different kinds of drugs to his friends. One character is addicted to drugs and alcohol. The combination of the violence, language, and sexual things on screen may offend some, but almost all of it is played for laughs.

Some scantily-clad females, but no nudity. A man unfastens his wife's dress as she lies back on a stone slab (we see her cleavage, abdomen and pregnant stomach), and he caresses her throat and movies down to her stomach. A man and a woman make out in a car, initially so they would not be recognized by who they're spying on, they seem to enjoy it afterwards. A man and a young girl (and the scenes show the girl as she grows up to be a young woman) practice Wu-Shu martial arts using hands and feet, then sticks and eventually swords. A man and a blindfolded woman fight as a test: the man throws metal balls at the woman and she catches them, she is knocked forward and nearly lands on a whirring saw blade, and then catches a sword blade between her hands as it comes down toward her. A man and a woman fight as a test: the woman is placed in painful positions a couple of times and we hear what sounds like bones cracking (she is not harmed). A young man holds a knife to a man's throat and steals a basket of fish. A man holds a gun to a woman's head while they are in a crowded marketplace, the woman gives him her money and the man leaves (no one is harmed). A man is forcibly taken away by several men, he struggles, his wife tries to attack the men and she is thrown to the ground and a young girl watches from a distance. Many armored vehicles drive into a crowded slum area, armed men get out of the vehicles, shove and beat the people and announce that they are being evacuated; we later hear gunshots in the crowd (we do not see anyone being shot). A woman fights several men with a shovel, a metal bar and a knife: all the men are rendered unconscious and one is trapped under a toppled shelving unit. A woman slams a man's head on a desk and twists his arm. Two women fight in a public restroom, one slams the other into a stall door and then onto the sink (it is glass and it breaks), they punch and kick each other, and one bends the arm of the other and we hear it cracking. Two men fight with punches and kicks, one man is thrown through a door (it splinters), and one man is slammed onto a table and held by the throat (we hear cracking and squishing but he is not killed). A man and a woman fight using bamboo rods; they are each struck repeatedly, and one is thrown back into bamboo scaffolding. A man slams a gas tank into the stomach of another man, and then uses it to lift and slam the man into the ceiling. A woman is tied upside down by her feet and two men are going to kill her, but she head butts one man, and then kicks the other while swinging from her tether. A man fights several men: one man's arm catches fire (he flails and screams) and one man is struck hard in the head with a baseball bat (we hear the blow). A woman fights a man who has blades attached to his hand: she throws a saw blade at him and his face is cut (we see the cut and a bit of blood), and then ties his ankles with a cable and hangs him over the side of a building (we are not sure if he is dead). Many men enter a house and fight a man with punches and kicks and flips; an RPG is fired into the house, it explodes and it is implied that everyone inside has been killed. Four men in an alley attack an elderly man as he walks by and they shove him to the ground and kick him repeatedly. A man breaks another man's neck with his hands (we hear a crack and the man falls to the floor). A man is stabbed through the leg by a metal rod (we see blood on the wound). A woman hanging by her hands is punched repeatedly by a man: we hear the blows and we see her hanging motionless with blood on her arms and head, and blood on the man's face and clothing (she is presumably dead). A woman jumps onto the neck of a man and spins and twists his head around (we see the man lying dead with blood in his mouth and his head is completely dislocated.) A man with long blades fitted to his hand jumps to the ground behind several men and attacks them: we hear the men screaming, we hear slashing and then the scene is quiet, implying that the men are all dead. We see a man place his hands on woman's bare, pregnant abdomen, we hear a crunch, we hear the woman scream and we understand that the man has broken through the flesh and removed a baby (we hear the baby cry). We see the severed heads of several men placed on plates at a table (there is blood at the neck and the skin is blue-tinged). A man is sprayed with steam from a pipe, and then the pipe is jammed into the man's stomach and we see his face bubble and he dies. After a man gives a threatening speech to business associates, one man says, ""We should kill him."" A man talks about a very sick infant having been left for dead after the parents died.

Some of these are really long and have full nudity including sight of genitals including an erection. Sex is shown in lots of positions. There are some strong sex references but these are not graphic. A woman performs analingus on another woman as she moans intensely. It should be noted that the sex between the two women is simulated and prosthetics are used; nevertheless, it is shot realistically and still very explicit. There are multiple explicit love scenes between two women with graphic nudity. Pornographic. A prolongued scene of lesbian sex with full frontal nudity and brief anus views of the actress (7 minutes) Two teenage girls argue; the argument escalates with name-calling and accusations until they lunge at each other and fight briefly (we see them pulling each other's hair and yelling) until they are separated by others. A woman and a younger woman argue about one of them being unfaithful; the argument includes yelling and shoving as the accused denies her infidelity; one shoves the other, shakes her then slaps her in the face before shoving her out of the apartment and slamming the door (the glass door shatters). Teenagers smoke and drink. None of this is done to excess, but more in a social manner.

The word ""cunt"" is used once very graphically in reaction to bullies at a school. There are multiple uses of ""fuck"" and milder language. Swearing occurs infrequently, but is strong when it does.

Nipple not shown. A woman is almost sexually assaulted by a possessed tree, it grabs her by the leg but she escapes. Although there is gore, the effects are goofy, over-the-top, and even dated by current standards. In one scene, a character squeezes another character's eyeballs. There are several instances of possessed being picking up and throwing other characters at objects or otherwise hitting them and abusing them. A possessed woman stabs another woman in the ankle with a pencil, and thick blood oozes out of the wound as she screams in pain. A man forces a woman into a cellar and hits her in the face with the handle of an axe to knock her out. A possessed woman scratches the side of a man's face with her fingernail, blood pours out of the wound. A possessed woman falls into a lit fireplace and her face is smoldering and bleeding when she gets out. A woman bites off her own hand, you see blood gush while she is chewing and you hear crunching of the bone while a man watches in horror. When she is finished she screams in pain and blood squirts and spews from the bloody stump. A possessed woman slashes a man with a voodoo knife and licks the blood off of it. In more than one instance, a man stabs a woman in the back with a voodoo knife, we see blood pour out the head of the knife. The woman then falls onto her back, driving the knife in further. When the woman is stabbed she spits out blood and a white substance. The same liquids pour out of all of her wounds. A man chops up a woman with an axe, you see blood splash off the axe each time he draws back and the axe making contact with and chopping off the woman's hand and foot. You then see the woman's bloody, severed body parts twitching on the ground. A possessed woman is shot in the head with a shotgun. Blood splurts out of the wound. A man hits a possessed woman in the head and face multiple times as she mocks him. A woman grabs a man's leg and scratches it untill we see bone, blood is pouring out of the wound while she does it. A woman jumps into the air and a man whacks her head off with a shovel. You see the body on top of the man still grabbing at him and blood spews and sprays in his face while the blood- splattered head comes alive. As a man is trapped in a cellar, the walls start oozing blood; a water pipe breaks and starts spewing blood all over the man. A light-bulb fills with blood pouring from the socket, turning the room red. It is implied that a man was attacked by the woods, we see his face badly cut and skin peeled off of it. He is covered with blood, and is still bleeding. Blood pours out of his mouth. A man shoots a woman in the head and neck, we see blood spurt from the wounds. A man grabs another man's leg and begins to bite into it, we see blood start to trickle out of the wound. A woman hits a man in the back with the blunt side of a fire poker. In a stop-motion sequence, the demons possessed bodies begin to decompose with lots of blood and gore as their bodies disintegrate. Their hair falls out, their flesh turns to goo, and blood pours everywhere. One of the bodies falls on the ground face first, and the head explodes covering a man completely in blood and chunks of brain. Giant hands rip apart two demonic possessed bodies, throwing their insides everywhere. Blood explodes onto another man. A mans head explodes. Blood sprays another man like a fire hose and brain matter flies all over the place. The main character pushes his thumbs into the eyes of a possessed man and a large amount of very thick blood oozes out. He then pulls a piece of wood out and a large stream of blood shoots out like a fountain. Several characters (noteably the protagonist) become absolutely covered in blood from head to toe. Drugs, recreational: None Some characters smoke and drink wine. Although alot of the effects are dated, The Evil Dead is still EXTREMELY bloody and graphic. Although very gory, the film has a lot of black comedy and it is also unintentionally funny sometimes Some uses of ""Shit"" No f words"

A woman's buttocks was shown and a man walks up to her and fingers roughly Early in the movie, the lead actress is working at a Las Vegas strip club, so we see several fully-nude women, though most of the dancers are topless and wearing very skimpy thongs. In one of these scenes, a fully-nude stripper is crawling erotically on all fours across the stage, away from the camera, exposing her shadowed vulva to the camera. In most other scenes, shadows, trimmed pubic hair, or careful camera work conceal the woman's genitalia when we see full frontal nudity. There are occasional brief flashes of labia in these scenes, but they're easy to miss. (Deleted. Personal opinions about content are not appropriate for the Parents Guide.) A woman gives a man a lap dance, during which she strips completely nude. At the climax of the dance, she vigorously dry humps him. It is implied that he has an orgasm. These topless stage shows are all erotic in some way. We see dance partners remove each others tops, caress each other, thrust their pelvises suggestively, etc. A man and woman dance suggestively together, him caressing her body, she rubbing that body against his. They begin to kiss erotically, and he pulls her top down, exposing her bared breasts with erect nipples. When he puts his hand down her pants, she warns him off, claiming her period. He doubts it, so she invites him to check. He pushes his hand deeper, then withdraws his hand and rubs his fingers together ruefully, realizing that she wasn't lying. A woman stands up from bed, shown completely nude from the rear. It is implied that she was having sex with a man shortly before this. A man and a woman strip nude and walk out to an outdoor swimming pool. We see the woman fully nude from the front and rear, and the man from the rear only. After a brief bit of skinny-dipping, the woman gives implied oral sex to the man underwater, then they copulate vigorously, then appear to achieve mutual orgasm. Her breasts are seen. The next scene is set the morning after in the man's bedroom, implying that they had sex again that night. We see the couple nude, the man still in bed, the woman sitting on the edge of the bed getting dressed. We see the woman nude from the rear as she dresses, displaying bared breasts, back and buttocks. We see the man's bared buttocks.

In several scenes, characters snort cocaine on-screen. The various club and social scenes often show characters smoking or drinking alcohol. The scene where a woman is raped is very intense and so disturbing, even if it's brief. Overall, many scenes are intense involving nudity and sensuality. A few emotionally intense scenes. The main character is quick to become angry and often lashes out. R18+ ( Nudity, Brief Scene Of Sexual Violence & Strong Adult Themes ) 'Sh*t' is said many times. 'Jesus' is said at least twice.

A man forcefully takes off a woman's clothes and has rough sex with her. Her butt is shown and the scene is bordering on S&M. A woman wakes up, takes off the sheet of the bed, and walks to the window. She is fully nude; her breasts and butt are shown, and her pubic region is briefly visible when she walks by a mirror. There are several sex scenes with a man and woman where they are in several positions with a lot of moaning and thrusting. The woman's breasts, butt, and pubic region are shown in most of these. The man's butt is shown, and once a brief view of his genital. These sex scenes last a while. A man pulls a gun and fires in the air, another man has a knife, and a couple of men then hold one man down, while another man stabs him slowly in the abdomen (we see blood ooze from the wound); the victim pulls the knife out and tries to use it on his attacker, who gets the knife back and stabs him again, repeatedly, he stumbles toward the door (we see blood on his hands and the floor), and someone else stabs him in the back several times, whereupon he falls down a flight of stairs, tries to get up and someone grabs his head and twists it breaking his neck (we hear a crunch). There is a rape scene with a married man and a young woman, who start out in a secluded room, presumably planning to have consensual sex: The man grabs the young woman, throws her against a wall, tears off her underwear, throws her onto a bed, removes his belt and strikes her with it several times, then ties her hands with the belt, removes his pants, climbs on top of her and thrusts; she moans in pain and pulls her hair (we see her lying on the bed afterward in the fetal position, with torn clothing and he leaves her there). Several people are grabbed violently, struck with clubs and forced to kneel on the ground at the edge of a deep quarry; some have bloody facial wounds from beatings and they are all shot one-by-one (we do not see the shootings or the aftermath). We see two dead bodies on a street (one has a bullet hole in the head with blood on the wound and pooled on the street). Two men collect dead bodies from the street (people who have died from starvation and exposure) and put them in a pile on a cart (we see grey-tinged skin and stained teeth). A man playing a soldier on stage wears a blood stained bandage on his leg. A man kicks another man in the head. Soldiers with guns shove people to their knees and rough them up.
Several people with guns prepare and hide as someone approaches an apartment door (nothing happens). People load guns and prepare for an attack. People with guns take target practice. A man runs out of a jewelry shop and dives into a car fearing an assassination attempt. A woman talks about a man ""hurting her until she bleeds so that he feels alive."" A man caresses a young woman's thigh and presses his hand between her legs while describing acts of violence: he talks about a man's brains being ""out"" and another man spilling his blood on him.

The scene includes a motorized plastic toy (underwater diver) swimming between the woman's legs up against her genitals (no genitals are seen). She appears to mildly enjoy contact with the toy. In another scene, a man is seen watching a sex tape of a woman masturbating alone; nudity includes bare breasts and partial view of hip/buttock. In one scene, as a woman changes clothing, she is shown completely naked from behind. As she partially turns, her breast is visible. In several other scenes, she is shown topless. Naked man and woman have intercourse on top of a bed. They change sexual positions. Thrusting and panting is shown. Explicit moaning. This is a very long scene.

The lead female character is a recovering drug addict. There are several scenes where this is discussed. There is movie cast party where drinking is occurring.
Several characters are shown as being drunk. The male character goes to buy drugs from a drug dealer. The initial attack scene can be disturbing to some, since we do not yet know the attacker's true intentions - particularly when he head-butts her to knock her out. A handful of F words as well as a scattering of other profanity throughout the movie."

Some of this dialogue is between a father and son. However, actual sex and nudity is kept brief or just implied. A brief sex scene occurs between a man and a woman; her breasts are shown, and his buttocks. Two characters make references to masturbation in one scene Two silhouetted figures are briefly shown preforming sex related acts. A man describes a sexual fantasy. Two clothed people heavily kiss on a couch; the man is shown putting his hand into the woman's shirt and groping her breast. Many scenes have references to masturbation. A young boy talks to his father about sex. A father and son frankly and openly discuss penis size. There are many scenes of sexual conduct, most of them being just sex talk and humor. Two different characters at different points of the movie are given death threats on the phone. A character commits suicide offscreen by suffocation; his corpse is briefly shown. A man drugs a little boy in order to rape him. Later in the film, we see the man driving to the house of another boy, apparently to rape him. Neither of the rapes is shown. A woman is raped in her apartment. They are shown in the lead-up and aftermath as clothed. After the rape, she kills him by breaking his neck. The woman tells this scene in flash-back, and a darkly comical edge offsets its potentially disturbing nature. A woman is pelted with vegetables by a crowd of protesters as she enters a building. A woman spits on a woman and drags her to the floor by her hair. A woman is shown with a black eye and bloody lip. It is implied to be from domestic abuse. Billy mentions that his teacher is a drug addict/junkie. A few characters drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes in some scenes. A man drugs his son's friends in order to rape them. Happiness is a very dark, and crudely disturbing movie. There is a theme of pedophelia throughout, and although no scenes of molestation are shown, it is still dark. Several of the characters in the film have social dysfunctions, which leads them to behavior that most people would find disturbing, for example making obscene phone calls, murder, and suicide. Most of the suspense in the film lies in its complete emotional bleakness. Very explicit and detailed sexual dialogue, some relating to paedophilia and rape. 20 uses of ""fuck"" 5 uses of ""shit"" 1 use of ""cunt"""

There is a long scene with Anaïs and June in bed together, kissing. Both feel each others breasts. Nothing really, some things are thrown in anger. Most of this is done socially. None.

Men and women are shown fooling around in several scenes, though nothing graphic is shown. Lots and lots of vagina-shaped objects are shown throughout the movie and one character wears a dildo on his head in several scenes. One of the characters in the film invents a handheld ray gun which, when shot at people, causes them to instantly orgasm. He and his friend use this on themselves to give themselves (clothed) orgasms, and we see and hear their pleasured responses. The two of them walk around town, using this orgasm gun on unsuspecting townsfolk, including pretty girls, some rabbis, and an old lady. All of these people are seen orgasming in comical ways. A man shoots a dog with the orgazmo gun and the dog (a German Shepherd) runs over to him and starts humping him the man tries to crawl away but the dog keeps on going, later on the man rings on a door and when it is opened the dog is still there humping the man's leg.

Much of the dialogue is filled with sexual double-entendres. There are several sex scenes filmed uncovered from either the side or behind. The sex generally has a clinical feel and is not lewd. One brief scene includes oral sex shown from the back of the woman's head. A man fires a phallic-tipped arrow into a woman's vagina. An older man courts three young men and examines them when they get to his place. Teenage characters in the film appear in full front and rear nudity. One scene features a man having sex with a teenage girl and another feature a man and a teenage boy getting into a bath together and later asleep in a bed. A live pigeon is slaughtered with a knife onscreen. A woman is thrashed, shackled, and slapped. A woman castrates a man using a rope. Two men are shown hanging on crosses by ropes. A woman has her hands and feet being chopped off before being beheaded. A couple of cuts in that scene show the actual blows, but each part is shown directly after. A young boy is stabbed to death in his sleep. The camera lingers over the blood coming from his mouth. There is a banquet in which one the characters gets drunk. Two sequences involve people being drugged. In one, an older couple drug a younger couple to perform a sexual test on them. In the other, a man drugs his enemy in order to kidnap his wife. In at least one scene, an old man is smoking a houkah.

A woman is seen for about a quarter of a second running, in a prolonged sequence of many flashing images that includes other naked breasts, her breasts and buttocks visible through a see-through black negligee. A man attempts suicide by leaping from a high place with his face then shown bloodied. There are several fist fights in the film, with bloody punches to the face. A woman threatens a man with a kitchen knife. A character under the influence of drugs kills several people; a man is beheaded with a sword (the act is offscreen but the severed head is seen rolling), another man is impaled with it in a bloody scene.

Her husband, fully nude, joins her, and they both talk to the neighbor. Nipples and vagina are visible on the woman, and the male's penis is visible. Multiple types of alternate sexual experiences are explored, including sexual pleasure by pouring food on the body, acting like a baby, licking dirt, homosexual cuddling, sexual pleasure by levitating, pleasure by smacking one's head against another person's head, pleasure from pooping and leaving it in random places, pleasure by publicly rubbing your genitals against someone else, and pleasure by oral sex. Between three and five non-explicit but nonetheless graphic uses of oral sex. No nudity is shown. Two men are seen naked, their penis' visible. A woman picks up a bottle with her vagina, fully visible. A woman with breasts the size of watermelons strips topless and starts dancing. Both nipples are visible. Two squirrels have sex together and fall through a ceiling. Non-graphic, though we do see thrusting. A snake bursts out of a man's crotch as a joke. Characters change from being excessively prudish to completely uninhibited when they receive concussions on their heads. All of these scenes are lighthearted and comedic. We see many ways the concussions happen through a variety of accidents. No one suffers serious injury. A squirrel is run over by a car (offscreen), but it is resuscitated. Several people smack their heads against each other's to get sexual pleasure. A man swallows a cup filled with prozac pills. The scene where a squirrel is run over might disturb some more sensitive viewers. The theatrical, NC-17 rated version uses occasional but not frequent profanity. The entire film centers on various alternative sexual experiences, some that are creative such as ta-tas instead of tits or funnin' instead of fuckin'. Sure older teens and adults will understand what they mean; but the alternative words will go over most kids heads therefore not making it too extreme when it comes to profanity.

Theres a blanket covering her nether regions. After talking for a bit, she suddenly yanks the blanket off of him. His penis and testicles can be seen in relative close up for several seconds. Very surprising and graphic scene. One man and one woman have full-frontal nude scenes and other partial nudity in plenty. Detailing the sex scenes might become repetitive, but a summary is in order. Woman waits for a man and she shows full frontal nudity. The other man is shown having sex with four different women. In three of the sex scenes he is fully clothed. In one he is partly obscured by the camera angle. Other scenes involve nudity and sexual contact as well. In one, he moves his hand up a woman's nickers. In two others, a woman massages his crotch under bedclothes. A woman pulls a blanket off him revealing his genitals in a lingering closeup. One of the women is shown nude when she pulls off her slip, preparing for sex but pubic area is only shown in a vaguely brief image. She is also shown topless as she undresses during a conversation. A second woman is fully nude as she stands bathing. The third woman is nude as she is cooking after sex. She also has a number of other scenes in which she appears topless--before, during, or after sex. Emily is shown topless and both her breasts and nipples are visible, her pubic region is only very briefly seen. The man then fondles one of her boob, The he lays her down on the ground and becomes naked himself. Then he penetrates her from the front.

No depictions of male genitalia. There are many, many scenes throughout the movie featuring full female nudity, humiliation/bondage/masochistic behaviour, kissing, groping, public nudity, masturbation and graphic intercourse. Some scenes of intercourse appear unwilling although they technically are not. The entire theme of the movie is of a submissive woman going through much sexual torments and joys to please her master. Said woman is willingly passed between several men. An extended part of the movie features a retreat for women who wear deliberately revealing 'easy access' clothing that exposes their breasts and buttocks. There are some sexual scenes between two women. Gore: None Some of the sexual submissive 'training' involved harsh whipping/beating of women, there are also two scenes of branding, one with heated metal in which the victim screams in agony and one with a cigar. A woman is struck by a man. Drugs: None Alcohol: Occasional social drinking, none to excess Scenes of smoking at random throughout, cigarettes and cigars. Some of the 'punishment' scenes, particularly those involving painful whipping, may be hard for some to stomach.

A sleazy older man picks up a teenage girl (played by an adult male) and takes her to a garbage dump where they have sex on a filthy mattress. He subsequently performs oral sex on her, as over-the-top sucking noises can be heard while the girl repeatedly tells him to ""eat it"". Traces of faeces are visible on the man's underwear. Both characters are played by Divine (which is why you do not see the two characters' faces in the same shot), and in a later scene, the man tells the woman to go ""fuck [herself]"" as a callback to the sex scene. There is no nudity in this scene. A brief but explicit scene of a naked woman bouncing on a naked man's face. Contains some genital detail. Two closeup shots of penises. A woman is shown fondling her breasts while looking at herself in a mirror. Several grown men make sexual propositions to a 14-year-old girl (she is, however, played by a 26-year-old actress). Brief, satirical references to child abuse: a mother attempts to beat her child with a car aerial and then chains her to her bed with the assistance of two friends. A woman on a stage fires a gun into the audience, killing one man. A riot ensues and police kill one man with a shotgun, resulting in a bloody face wound. A woman throws acid into another characters face, resulting in bloody burns and later, grotesque disfigurement. A woman is locked in a giant birdcage and later has her hand chopped off. Her bloody stump of a wrist is seen. A man is (unrealistically) stabbed to death with a kitchen knife, with bloody results. A riot results in several deaths. A woman is electrocuted in the electric chair onscreen. All violence in the film is deliberately over-the-top and so unrealistic that they cannot be taken seriously. A woman takes a recreational intravenous injection (of liquid eyeliner) in her arm in order to get high and ""heighten one's beauty awareness"".

There is an orgy sequence which includes simulated sex with both same and opposite sex pairings. Men are shown being disinfected with white powder and showering it off; they keep their crotches covered with their hands. Two clothed men talk themselves to orgasms while standing perfectly still without touching themselves or each other.

The F-word is used a six times, both as an expletive and in its literal meaning. The S-word is used twice.

They are also seen briefly kissing. Because the movie is a comedic horror film, the violence is intentionally over the top, fake looking, and played for laughs. Extreme graphic violence and gore throughout, including decapitations, disembowelings, and bisections via an oversized meat cleaver. Please note that the gore is wayyyy over the top (and somewhat intended to be comical). A man slaughters an entire house : he chops ones face to ribbons, chops a man's head in half vertically, decapitates two, slashes one's back, stomps one one's head, chops at a woman's stomach which causes her intestines to gush out, chops a man from his crotch up (we see blood splatter) and breaks one's neck. We see a woman with her feet cut off. A man has a circular saw taken to his stomach and he then is decapitated. A man has part of his face chopped at, his feet cut off and his arms cut off. A man is chopped in half horizontally. In a flashback we see a man who has his head impaled on a stick. We see a woman with half her face skinned off. We see two people slaughter a group of teens : One has is legs cut off and is disemboweled, one has the eye bitten out, one is chopped in half horizontally, one' s head is smashed with a sledge, one is chopped at, the killers start hacking the corpses to pieces (we later see the dismembered parts). A man has his throat slit. A man has half has head chopped off. A woman is bludgeoned by a car. A clown is shot to death. Moments later we see the body. No blood or gore is involved. At the end of the movie we see a woman driving a car covered in blood. A circus performer drinks in his home. We see a man working at a restaurant smoking. Frightening/intense scenes throughout, including a homicidal circus clown, dark warehouse, and scenes of extreme violence and gore. F**k and Sh*t are used many times throughout the movie including many more swears and terms that some could be offended by.

During the sex scenes, breasts, butts (male and female), female pubic regions, and penises are visible. Though blurred out, a man is shown masturbating. The sex scenes include oral sex (both males going down on females and females going down on males), breasts bouncing, and lots of groping. A woman is shown fully nude in the shower, breasts and pubic region visible. A man pranks her by using a dildo and recreating the shower scene from ""Psycho"". The intro is of a crime scene investigation where some bodies are shown throughout a property, some of which have blood from bullet wounds. The fake rape scenes in the beginning of the film are fairly violent, though they are acting. A man takes a stone and bludgeons a man to death. Lots of blood and skull-crunching noises heard. A woman enters a room and a man hits her over the head with a baseball bat. She is shown falling down but no blood. A few people are shot. A man pulls down another man's pants and then rams a dildo up his rectum. A man hits another man over the head with a pistol. Some cigarette smoking.  Constant swearing, mostly the ""f"" word.

One scene lasts nearly 6 minutes around the midpoint of the movie. Breasts and butts are clearly visible, as well as very brief glimpses of both male and female pubic hair. There are also a couple of very brief glimpses of a penis. The main character is a photographer of models. The models are often shown wearing sexy clothing, bras/panties, or bikinis, a lot of which are thongs. The camera zooms in on their breasts and butts often. A woman is shown fully nude in a shower, her butt visible. She is shown later again when a man enters. Her breasts, erect nipples and butt are visible and they kiss and have sex.

Strong graphic sexual dialog throughout. In a cinema, people watch a pornographic film. A man sits on a bed wearing only an ascot next to a woman in a nightgown. She points and laughs at his penis, and he takes his ascot off and strangles her with it. He then tears her nightgown off, and rapes her. He also squeezes her breast to a humorous honking sound. This is simulated, but you see his buttocks and possibly his penis, her breasts, and very briefly, her pubic hair. The film concerns the making of this porno. A woman lies down in a nightgown, and we can very possibly see her labia through the bottom. A man tries to convince another man to commit necrophilia, but fails. A man tells a woman to take her blouse off. She complies, revealing a see-through teddy. They retreat to the bed for more filming. He pulls her teddy off, revealing her breasts. She remains topless for the rest of the film (over 40 minutes). For filming, a man fondles, and licks the woman's breasts and nipples. This scene is extremely erotic and sensual. After this, the woman pretends to be raped, but nobody is having sex with her for real. The woman reveals her vagina as part of the film. We see this from behind. The woman unsuccessfully tries to seduce the impotent man, before finally noting he has an erection at the sight of her naked body. He pulls down his pants, and he climbs on top of her body. He moves down and bites her leg sexually, then crawls back up. He then thrusts into her, and they both orgasm. This scene is also extremely erotic and sensual. During all of these scenes past the above spoiler warning, we only see the woman's breasts. In a film being screened within the film, a woman is strangled with an ascot and is raped. (See Sex & Nudity). A woman injects herself with heroin. A woman is pushed off a sofa. While filming a movie, woman is brutally strangled with an ascot again, before being punched repeatedly while being raped. The woman is unaware that the rape is actually violent. (See Sex & Nudity) A man's head is hit with a bottle. A woman's leg is bitten in a sexual manner. We later see the bite mark. Two men have a fight. It is broken up when another man hits one man in the head with another bottle. Alcohol: One character drinks to excess throughout the film. Drugs: explicit drugs use Smoking: Frequent cigarette smoking The rape scene is extremely graphic and disturbing. Strong, crude, graphic, and sexual dialog throughout. Several uses of strong profanity (e.g. fuck, cunt) in crude sexual contexts. There is also use of moderate profanity (e.g. shit, tits).

A man gets hit in the crotch with a crowbar and says 'You smacked my winkie'. As Alice bends over, the back of her pants rip, exposing her red underwear. A man is seen with his trousers down. Alex is seen peeling stickers off of a poster with a topless woman. Very little is shown, but Stan's parrot says 'If those are real I'm an eagle'. Alex is seen taking his trousers down to inspect his rear end in the mirror, but only his lower legs and upper body are ever shown. Karen says that Alex's body is covered in chicken pox spots, to which Molly asks 'Would that include his buttock region?' Mr Pruitt is seen without his trousers. It takes him some time to realise. At the end we see a small amount of red in a mans crotch area from getting hit with a crowbar. It is not overly graphic Mainly played for laughs: a remote control car smacks someone in the face A man is hit by a car and lands on the windshield, men run into each other, a woman is dragged by a dog through some bushes A man falls several stories through the house landing on some planks then on a toilet. The toilet crushes down causing water the leak, others fall through the porch (after wooden planks hit them on the head), and Alice falls several stories down a dumbwaiter and we hear a crash. (All slapstick no harm done) A large book-filled chest falls from an attic window and lands on two of the men. Moments later, a barbell with weights then hits the two on their heads. A woman gets her hand stuck on goo in a trap and that removes her glove. She climbs over the fence and lands on tar. She gets stuck and trips on a string. A flower pot from the third story falls on her head a couple times. A man trips on a welcome mat under which there are marbles and he hits his nose on the knocking horseshoe. A criminal peeks through a mail hole and a young boy uses graffiti and sprays his eyes. His eyes look like goggles but no harm was done. He gets a saw and breaks the door open. A woman tries holding on the rails of the stair but it breaks apart. She falls her back on the stairs crushing her back. She tries doing another se of gymnastics and sucessfully lands on the porch but the planks have no stableness causing her to fall down to the closet. A man goes to a porch and the planks tilt hitting his head and making him fall into a closet landing on a woman. An intruder who is from the window steps on muddy glue in a cart. He starts rolling over uncontrollably and bumps into some objects. He enters the basement and the wheels trip on a bump making him do a handstand. He goes down the stairs and gets his hand caught on a mousetrap causing him to shoot the pipes. The pipes lead to the toile causing the toilet to unclog onto the man. The waste goes on the man's face (disgusting). An intruder tries getting in the window but a kid with a handlebar attached to a plastic bag full of snow hits the intruder's face. His face is covered with snow and the man gets a deflated balloon out of his tongue. A man finds a doll that looks like a kid who he wants to kidnap. He pulls and pulls making him activate a mower. He actually pulls a doll and the mower activates causing it to fall from the hole onto the man's head. (In real life this would've caused a gory impact) but due to the PG rating he actually gets his head shaved. A kid screws a nail on the front door and the man tries breaking in but the nail hits his hand. He reacts with ""OW"" four times. A man hears a kid crying (it is actually a doll) and gets trapped when he opens a door causing a boxing glove to hit his crotch. He falls down and all his ammo explodes onto his butt. The kid reacts with facial expression. A man and a woman tries charging at a kid but two of them charge at him at the same time causing them to fall. The man tries getting through, the kid closes the door making him bump his head. A man and woman tries getting a kid. They figure to use the trampoline to land so they both jump from the attic to the trampoline. The trampoline was on top of a pool of ice which causes it to break apart and for them to shiver in cold. A hook attaches to a man's shirt. He tries getting it out and pulls causing a sprinkler to spray on his head. He tries stopping the sprinkler pulling harder but that just causes the sprinkler to spray on his scrotum. A man hides in an igloo. A parrot comes in and lites a bunch of fireworks. The fireworks blast him out. A woman kidnaps a dog. The kid tries using a dog whistle to rescue the dog. The dog starts running and that ties the woman's' legs dragging her to a bunch of bushes. At the end the woman stands up and her pants rip apart exposing her underwear (played for laughs). Like the 1st and 2nd movie there is slapstick violence: Alice whacks a man in the crotch with a stick when she sees Alex's pet rat poking its head out from the man's torn clothing. A woman falls a couple stories through the floors of a house. A woman binds and gags an elderly woman with duct tape and leaves the garage door open. Two men are electrically shocked, one by a chair rigged to a car battery, the other by grabbing electrified wires. His glove gets blown off and a lightning bolt fires off his butt (played for laughs). The other guy gets pushed to a wooden wall after the shock. Alex drops objects from the house on to the bad guys. Not much. An elderly lady smokes a cigarette and drinks whiskey. All the violence is played for laughs Not much. 2 uses of ""Oh my God"", & 3 of ""Oh God"". A couple slang terms were used: ""thing"" & ""winkie"". The word ""damn"" is used by a parrot singing ""Bad Bad Leroy Brown"". The word ""hell"" is used a few times in a song called ""My Town"" by Cartoon Boyfriend."

We only see them floating on the surface before he snatches them up. One of the bandits flirts with a woman who then slaps him. A sign at a motel reads ""Adult Films"" Kevin is embarrassed at the hotel porter holding up a pair of his laundered boxer shorts. Kevin grabs a woman's butt and she slaps Harry and Marv in the face Kevin watches a movie in which a woman is shot to death by a man who laughs maniacally as he does so. A gloved woman punches Harry and Marv in the face and knocks them both unconscious. A man opens a door which a string is tied to a bag and that releases wrenches on his head. A man gets shot with a nail gun after opening a knob. The nails land on the man's torso and nose. A man falls from the first floor to the basement and lands with a thud. The man cracks his neck done for slapstick. A man walks on slippery slime and that makes his fall and slide to a shelf of paint and that lands on him covering him with paint. A man is electrocuted with a sink and his skeleton is seen! Two man trip on beads from a necklace. Two men opens a knob which slides from the stairs onto the door and that slides both of them to a wall breaking both their noses. A man gets his head caught on fire with a lighter and he panics doing a handstand on a toilet with kerosine. The building explodes. A man tries getting a kid on a ladder but it breaks making him fall on the floor possibly breaking his fingers. A man tries hopping on a ladder with slime and falls. A blob of slime lands on his head. At the Christmas pageant Buzz starts a fight and Kevin punches him and the show breaks up and a woman gets knocked back in the piano chair. This is meant for laughs. Kevin watches another robbery movie in the hotel with a machine gun. Like the first Home Alone there is slapstick violence but it's a little more harsh in this one: Harry, one of the bad guys, flies out and falls on a car and shatters the window. Marv, the other bad guy, gets electrocuted by the sink when Kevin hooks a generator to it. Both bad guys get bricks thrown at them but Marv ends up being the only one to get hit. The bad guys get other traps done on them. Staple gun, paint cans, tool chests, tools etc. Harry and Marv point a gun at Kevin, The bird lady throws bird seeds at them and they eat on them and yell. The birds eating on them is the funny part of this scene. Kevin watches a movie in which a character is seen smoking. Brief smoking is seen by two women in the park. Some may be a bit disturbed at the level of violence towards and given by children with the two bandits, despite most of them being played for laughs. Marv is seen being electrocuted, switching between human view, and skeletoral view. Much more violent than the first one. A few scenes involving the Twin Towers which may prompt questions from viewers born after 9/11. Kevin can be seen wandering alone in New York, Central Park at night with scary people bullying him and the taxi driver even scaring him. Buzz says 'Enough of this gooey sh...', before hastily changing tack and finishing with 'show of emotion'. 'D*mmit' is said once. 'Big horse's *ss' is said once. One use of 'You little sh...', but it gets cut off. The Lord's name is taken in vain a few times."

He then comments that there's ""no clothes on anybody. Sickening"". No nudity. Buzz asks his cousin if it's true that French babes don't shave their pits and says they've got nude beaches. Harry says 'I'll snap off your cojones' when threatening Kevin. Kevin puts aftershave on his face in two scenes, which causes him to scream once he realizes how painful it is. This is not violent at all and meant for comedic effect A man walks into a shop with blood stained gauze on his hand. Kevin watches a movie called Angels with Filthy Souls and a deal between two gangster-type characters goes awry, with the character named Johnny killing another man with a machine gun, which frightens Kevin. It is kind of graphic, smoke can be seen and Johnny laughs sadistically while killing the man. Black and white. The scene is repeated two times more later in the film, but used for comic effect. Comedic action and slapstick violence: Kevin climbs the shelf in Buzz's room and it breaks, he and everything falls. Kevin shoots action figures down the laundry chute with Buzz's BB gun. Kevin sets traps for the bad guys. They burn themselves, step on stuff that hurts, fall on stuff etc. They step on spikes and ornaments that hurt their feet, while wearing no shoes nor socks, get hit in the head with an iron, slip on ice, and get hit with a paint can. In one scene near the beginning there is a drunk man on TV. You can barely hear him. Mild drinking on the plane. A man dressed as Santa Claus smokes a cigarette. The stories of Old Man Marley, a.k.a. ""The Shovel Slayer"" are particularly disturbing, but he turns out to be very nice. In two iconic scenes, Kevin puts aftershave on his face and due to how painful it proves to be, it causes him to scream. Several scenes show a pet tarantula which may be jarring to those who are scared of spiders. Kevin's rude behavior towards his mom might be saddening Robbers are threatening towards Kevin. The slapstick finale is comically intended yet some of the booby traps (For example; one of the robbers steps bare foot on a rusty nail sticking up on the floor) can be fairly disturbing/cringeworthy. No blood is ever shown in these sequences. A few mild swears here and now and then. A-word and H-word used occasionally Shit is used once or twice"

Some innuendo, nothing to strong, Farmers use guns frequently, but there is no blood. Comical fighting is shown. There are two scenes in which characters claw at other characters, leaving deep scratches, but no blood. Animals are electrocuted by an electric fence, but no one is hurt. Mr. Fox kills chickens with his teeth. There is a reference to how grisly and bloody the process is, but it is an over-exaggeration and meant for humorous purposes, complete with comical discretion shots. Franklin Bean is seen smoking a cigarette every time he appears. Bean also keeps a cellar full of hard apple cider, very alcoholic, which Mr. Fox steals along with Boggis and Bunce's chickens. The animals also drink the alcoholic cider. On one occasion, Mr. Fox is seen smoking a tobacco pipe. Mrs. Bean brandishes a knife when two children foxes are in the kitchen. May make some feel intense The fight between Mr. Fox and Rat inside an electric generator room underground may be considered intense or scary for younger viewers. Most of the scene is in darkness, but brief moments of their fight are lit up by the crackling electricity. (Violent sounds may be heard.) Instead of using profanity, characters say sentences that would contain a swear word (especially the F word), but the word is replaced by the word ""cuss"" as a running joke. Some examples include ""You scared the cuss out of us,"" ""Don't you cuss with me,"" ""What the cuss,"" and ""cluster cuss."""

Mouth is seen looking at a girlie magazine in a deleted scene at the convenient store. No nudity is seen. Troy adjusts the rear view mirror of his car to look up Andy's skirt and her panties are seen. She yells at the boy and he stops. She later says she elbowed his lip cause he was trying to look down her shirt. Andy wears a white cheerleader outfit with a super short skirt that barely covers her rear, and her underwear is shown multiple times throughout the movie. While no obvious body parts are seen through her white outfit when she's wet, her underwear is seen a lot in the movie while running, squatting on the ship and falling off the plank. Troy is showed sitting on the toilet reading a magazine when he's suddenly shot up into the ceiling by a water surge. Area around his man parts is seen as he shoots up but he's wearing red underwear to blend in with his red sweatsuit so his private area is covered up. Mouth works as a translator for the house who doesn't speak English. With subtitles in English Mouth tells Rosalita not to go up in the attic cause Mr. Walsh keeps his sexual torture devices stored up there and he uses suggestive movements. She stares at the attic door for a minute. As a joke Mouth puts his tongue through a hole in a painting of a woman and makes crude remarks to Mikey. Pinchers of power attach to Francis' crotch. In a deleted scene the pinchers of power attach to Mouth's butt. Inside a locker room old geezers are shown in the shower. Only their chests are seen. Mouth tells Chunk he has naked pictures of him his mom bathing, which he doesn't and he was just using it as a ruse to make Chunk angry so he can break down a door. Steph tells Mouth he looks better from behind. Indicating she likes his butt. Andy asks Brand if she has a great body. He agrees. Boys are scene urinating against a wall. Their backs are facing the camera so nothing is shown. Steph punches Mama Fratelli in the jaw before jumping off the ship and swimming away. Mentioned in the sex & nudity section, Troy is shot up in the air while on the john and hits the ceiling head first then falls on the floor. He's unharmed. Played for laughs. Francis holds his hand out and ask his mom for her sword. They both are not paying attention and she taps the palm of his hand with the sharp edge of the sword and he yelps in pain, no blood shown. Kids are caught and tied up by the bad guys. Swords are held to their throats as they try to make them walk the plank one by one. Lots of peril and screaming throughout. Sloth is chained. Chunk is kidnapped and questioned by the bad guys and threatened with dismemberment by a blender. Francis yanks Andy by the hair he does the same thing to Steph and she tells him to stop. Fratelli brothers pull out guns and threaten to kill each other over pizza. Jake grabs Data and a boxing glove springs from his coat and punches him the face. Floor gives out from underneath Data and he falls and is nearly impaled by spikes. His friends cry thinking that he's dead but he informs them that he was saved by the pinchers of power. Same thing happens again to him two more times. Man is knocked unconscious by a water fountain. Hit sends him flying back first against a fence. Intended to be funny. Kids and the Fratelli's are attacked by a swarm of bats. No blood showed. Troy pulls up next to Brand in his convertible. Andy offers him a ride and he declines. Troy grabs his hand and accelerates to high speeds. Andy and Steph plead with him to stop but Brand who his on a kiddie bike ride off a short cliff. He's later showed with a few scrapes on his face. Characters are threatened with guns, but they are never shot, only shots we hear are in the background. No injury detail shown. The Goonies watch two men enter a restaurant, and several gunshots are heard. We later on see the three villains carrying large garbage bags to the kitchen through a window and it is implied the corpses are inside. Chunk relates a story about dumping fake vomit from a movie theater balcony onto people below, causing patrons to actually vomit on each other. Jake and Francis wrestle/knock heads/try to choke each other. Adventure and action including chase sequences and adult threats to children with guns and swords. Human corpses are shown in various states of decomposition, most depicted having died violent deaths. Children escape death by multiple booby-traps throughout the movie. Data is sometimes mildly injured by his own inventions. These incidents are played for gags. Jake is seen smoking a cigarette. Mouth plays a trick on a Spanish cleaning woman by telling her (in Spanish with English subtitles) that she needs to ""always seperate the drugs"" into the appropriate drawers, citing marijuana, cocaine, speed, and heroin. No characters do or reference doing drugs, though Mouth makes a reference to ""downin' some brews"". Jake Fratelli smokes cigarettes a few times. Alcohol is seen and referenced once by the villains. Chunk is seen sobbing intensely while being question by the bad guys because they threatened to put his hand in a blender. Tense when Sloth pulls the chains off the wall as he heard straining. Boy going to use the bathroom hears bellowing sounds and goes to investigate. He spies on a bad guy mistreating and singing loud opera to a chained up man who screams in frustration and covers his ears. Bad guy gets upset and throws food at at him. He leaves his food on the floor as the man cries out 'food please.' He continues singing loudly while the man pleads for food, saying 'woe is me'. Boy uses a stick to move the food closer to his reach but when he sees his face which is partially shadowed he gasps and runs away. Kind of jump scare when the boy is grabbed from behind while he's running away and it appears to be one of the bad guys. It's not. Jake and Francis slip and fall landing astride a log, hurting their groin. They have wide pained expressions on their face. Mama ask the first one if he's okay. He answers no with a high-pitched voice indicating how much pain he's in. But it's played for laughs. A skeleton is discovered with both it's legs crushed by a boulder and with insects such as worms, maggots and beetles crawling on it and coming out of it's eye sockets. Younger viewers will find the scene extremely frightening and will find it rather disturbing. 15 uses of shit A boy spells out the phrase ""holy shit"" instead of outright saying it. Brand's mother stutters while trying to tell him he'll be ""in deep shit"" he lets his brother out. He says it for her and she smacks him. Chunk says ""shit"" and she doesn't get mad at him. Pretty strong language for a PG film. This film probably may have been rated PG-13 if it was released today. Quite a bit profanity such as ""balls"" (used once), ""bullshit"", ""(holy) shit"", ""cut the shit"", ""damn"" and ""pissing"" said multiple times by both children and adults throughout the film. Several very mild sexual references but no sexual words or slang used other than ""balls"" once. Idiot is said once."

It's tail wags across a piano playing a brief note of creepy music. It chases him and Judy down the stairs nimbly but it trapped in a bedroom by Alan Parrish who was summoned on the same roll. A boy is beaten by several other kids but it is hidden by a stone with an address. His lip bleeds. A hunter shoots at several people. Sam Parrish is seen smoking a pipe early in the film. A homeless man is seen smoking a pipe in an abandoned factory. About midway through the movie, Alan summons a hunter who chases after him and repeatedly tries to shoot him. At one point, he tries to shoot Alan in the head, but misses. There is a scene which involves many spiders crawling all over the attic. When the kids use the board game, the animals come out and some of their appearances are quite freaky. When the game starts near the beginning of the movie, young Alan is slowly sucked into the game (using CGI, of course). The appearance of him screaming and slithering into the game is quite frightening, and scary music plays at the same time. Right after this, young Sarah screams and runs out of the house in terror as dozens of bats begin chirping loudly and emerge from the fireplace. Alan drives a police car through a grocery store, destroying it in the process. Eventually, an entire shelf of paint cans falls on Van Pelt (this is played for comedic effect). A stampede chases Alan, Sarah, Judy and Peter throw the house, but they all leap out of the path at the last second. In a scene, Alan and Sarah play the game and Alan is trapped inside the jungle, with bats flying and Sarah running away, afraid. 26 years later, Alan is set free. Scenes involving the bats, lions, huge mosquitos, monkeys, dangerous flowers, elephants, spiders, an obsessed hunter and crocodiles. Monkeys destroy a kitchen and throw knives at two young children; they also scare several people, crash a car, steal TV's, hijack a motorcycle and damage a shop. A stampede of elephants, rhinos, birds, zebras and other animals run through a town, injuring some people and damaging many things; Peter is almost crushed to death inside a car. Peter is almost killed by a giant plant. Giant spiders attack people. Peter tries to kill the spiders with an axe. Dozens of bats chase Sarah down a street. A couple uses of damn and hell.

None In a quidditch match, a Slytherin player takes his team's beater's club and whacks a bludger at Oliver Wood unaware of it and he falls backwards on his broomstick behind a goal hoop then falls to the ground. However, his injured body is not seen throughout the match and survives by being seen in the second film. In the same match, two Slytherin players railroad a Gryffindor chaser into a pillar, and she crashes to the ground from behind a banner. We see her unconscious, but otherwise fine. Snape's leg is pretty bloody in one scene Harry is verbally abused by his relatives a few times. Neville falls from an airborne broomstick and breaks his wrist. Mild The three headed dog tries to eat a few characters Quirrel faints but it's more comedic than anything Harry's family is abusive... pushing, name calling, showing contempt None One person is briefly shown smoking a pipe. A rather large snake escapes and terrorizes visitors at a zoo exhibit. You can see a black hooded figure moving about in a forest. At one point he's slumped over a seemingly dead unicorn and appears to be eating it. The figure is about to attack Harry, but is stopped.

A psychiatrist admits that he lost his license due to affairs with his patients. PG for some suggestive material including sexual references and for violence, brief language and drinking While there are no explicit sex or nudity, some female characters show a lot of cleavage, which other characters are often shown staring at (played for comedy); in a scene there is some passionate kissing and groping (again played for laughs, as the characters are trying to distract a cop); some sexual humor and references to topics like homosexuality, adultery, prostitution. One of the characters is a French maid who wears a revealing dress. Several of the other characters stare noticeably at her cleavage. At one point when she sits, her skirt flies up and her underwear is shown; the underwear is plain and modest. One character starts to lift her skirt flirtatiously, and she pulls away from him. Professor Plum and Miss Scarlet pretend to kiss passionately while sensually wrapped around each other in a sexual position, in an effort to distract another character. Professor Plum also attempts to demonstrate a sexual position with another character. Lots of sexual humor and references and double entendres, much of which can definitely go over a kid's head - such as references to flies and being ""exposed"". A lot of staring at cleavage, two instances of characters grabbing a female's butt. There are discussions of affairs and prostitutes, and various references to sex; one of the characters runs a prostitution ring. A gun is used to shoot at various things in the house, including a door lock and chandeliers; one man is slightly wounded by one of these shots. A woman hits a man in the crotch with her knee out of anger. One character admits that she has been married five times, with some of her husbands dying or disappearing; other characters suspect she may have killed them. A hysterically screaming woman is slapped to calm her down, and this is later re-enacted by another character. PG for some suggestive material including sexual references and for violence, brief language and drinking A woman is stabbed in the back (seen from in front of her). When her body is found, there is little blood seen. Her body is comedically carried to others places in the house, and is dropped at one point. A man is killed by being hit on the head with a wrench, slightly offscreen. His body is later comedically posed. A woman is shown being strangled to death by a rope noose in one scene, and again in flashbacks. An off-duty police officer is killed by being hit over the head with a lead pipe. A woman is shot to death (no blood), and the shooting is seen again in flashbacks. Two men shoot at each other, with one of them killed (no blood). Alcohol is spilled on a corpse to make him appear drunk rather than dead. Various characters casually drink alcohol including cognac and whiskey, and some are occasionally seen smoking - unsurprising, as the film is set in 1954. Vicious guard dogs are depicted in the opening scene and one later scene. The characters are served a dinner in which the main course is later revealed to be something some viewers may find disgusting. Various characters are unnerved by creepy attics, cellars and darkened rooms in an old mansion, particularly after a power failure. The whole plot revolves around several murders, and some people may find it scary. However, the movie is a black comedy, and has a very light tone. One character refers to homosexuals often being called fruits. ""Bastard"" is said once. ""Oh my God"" used several times."

A group of Huns tries to tear the arms and legs off of a man, but are quickly stopped. A character reads from a history book describing and illustrating this act (without blood). A mild amount of violence. One fist fight shows a cut with a small amount of blood. Three men attack a man, one throws him, one punches him, one kicks him in the face, and one kicks him and does a pile driver on his back knocking him to the floor.
A horse drawn carriage runs out of control, going toward a woman, and a man pushes her out of the way, she is knocked to the ground, and turns back and sees that the man has been run over and cut in half (we see his two pieces severed at the waist); the man is still talking and explains that he is fine because he is made of wax and the woman drips hot candle wax on him in order to put him back together. A T-Rex skeleton in a museum drinks water from a fountain, a man sees it and runs, the T-Rex roars and chases him, snapping, the man hides under a desk, and the T-Rex picks up the desk in his teeth and throws it. A Civil War re-enactment shows explosions, and soldiers fighting with bayonets (we don't see any injuries but do see soldiers falling to the ground). A man walks past two large statues with human bodies and jackal heads; they become animated and stab at him with their spears (they miss), the man opens a sarcophagus, a mummy thrashes and struggles to get out, and it unwraps itself to show a young man. A T-Rex skeleton chases a horse-drawn carriage, a remote control car slips and explodes after running over a snow drift (we are led to believe that the two men inside the car have died), and a man is thrown off the carriage and into snow when the horses stop short.  It is revealed that if anyone brought to life by the tablet is outside the museum when the sun rises, they will turn into dust. In one scene, this happens to a caveman, and the dust falls straight down before a street sweeper cleans it up. A tyrannosaurus comes to life, and it appears at first to be trying to eat the main character (he only wants to play fetch). A wax human attempts to tear a mans limbs off which might scare younger viewers. The whole prospect of wax humans and statues coming to life might scare younger viewers. A scene where Larry locks up the lions might scare younger viewers. (They're not actually attacking him. They're just standing there rawring and acting like pet cats and dogs; even the male was standing at the locked gate acting like a dog whining when a person locks the door; however, Larry is earlier given a list of instructions saying ""lock up the lions or they'll eat you."") Probably a few dammits but basically none"

Hoggle, when first introduced, is shown urinating into a pool while viewed from his backside. Being indicated to be modeled after one of Sarah's biological mother's old flames (for whom she ultimately abandoned Sarah and her father), Jareth the Goblin King is stated to be in love with the underage pubescent Sarah, and his romantic desire for her is heavily implied not to be entirely unrequited. In one dream sequence, she and he have a slow dance with each other at a rather decadent masquerade ball; and near the end, as he's making one final appeal to her, some of the things he says are highly reminiscent of sexual domination and submission fantasies. A character is seen trying to exterminate little winged-humanoid-style fairies with some kind of pesticide spray, though none of them are shown to die from it. A number of goblins with toothy creatures on sticks are seen tormenting the character Ludo with them, though none of their bites draw any blood. Despite a few ominous mentions of certain paths through the labyrinth bringing ""certain death"" no one actually gets killed on screen. The ""Fireys"" who turn up in one scene are creatures who playfully take off their heads and limbs and toss them around and reassemble them in odd configurations with each other (and talk of doing the same to the heroine as she's fleeing). At the entrance to the goblins' city, a huge metallic guardian attacks Sarah and her party with an axe, though they manage to dodge all of its strokes. It ultimately spins out of control and falls apart among explosions and clouds of smoke. In the city, the goblins attack and besiege Sarah's party with blunt and bladed weapons, a couple of cannons, and even some kind of machine-gunner, but despite the property damage, mayhem, and general pandemonium that ensues from their attack and the counterattack from Sarah's friends, no one draws any actual blood. The (hollow and metallic) machine-gunner ultimately gets crushed under a rock. During the ""Magic Dance"" number, goblins are seen drinking some unknown beverage drawn into their steins from a keg while they party, with one goblin lying like a drunkard with his mouth open under the tap trying to catch any excess drops. A peach Jareth has Hoggle give Sarah induces a surreal dream sequence very much like a drug trip which is followed by amnesia, heavily implying that it's been spiked with something hallucinogenic. There are general fairy-tale themes of child abandonment, endangerment, and kidnapping. A paranoia-inducing early scene in Toby's darkened bedroom with goblins popping out from various places, laughing at Sarah behind her back, and then disappearing before she can turn around to see them may be too traumatic for any children young and imaginative enough to be scared of there being monsters under their beds. Jareth's sudden arrival through the open bedroom window, accompanied by thunder and lightning. He produces a snake out of a crystal ball and throws it at Sarah. Sarah's sudden drop into a pit and surreal encounter with the ""helping hands"" on its walls. Ludo's tormenters has toothy stick monsters. Sarah and Hoggle's encounter with the ""cleaner"" machine, a metallic tunnel-filling device that threatens them with numerous whirling blades and spikes that look capable of shredding flesh and bone. The ""Bog of Eternal Stench"" makes anyone who falls into it stink forever. A couple of sequences in which characters are in serious danger of falling into it. The surreal masquerade ball shows its participants' strange behaviour and Sarah's obvious confusion over Jareth's romantic overtures to her. Some mild crude humor, including a character urinating into a pool of water, fart noises being played loudly in the 'Bog of Eternal Stench' scene, and a character belching. 'Fragging' is said twice by a goblin. David Bowie's song ""Underground"" in the opening credits says that truth ""hurts like hell"" in a line repeated in its reprise for the closing credits. A character asks Sarah whether she's really going to ""listen to that crap"" when she's seeking advice from a guru. Sarah says ""Damn!"" a few times when she's frustrated, and Hoggle curses Jareth and himself in the same manner in one scene. Five uses of damn"

However, the color of the underwear is too similar to the skin tone. So it looks like a vagina even though there was never actually any nudity. (In the DVD release, this was reanimated with Jessica's dress fully covered) Jessica's dress is scantily clad. A character puts their hand in Jessica's cleavage area but their hand gets trapped and someone says ""Nice booby trap"" In one scene, Eddie's pants fall down when talking to Jessica showing him in his underwear. A character walks underneath a woman beneath her dress In one scene, Eddie gets up off the floor bumping into Jessica's breasts. Baby Herman tells Eddie that he has a ""50 year-old lust and a 3 year-old dinky."" Most kids probably won't get what it's supposed to mean. Jessica slaps Eddie across the face in one scene. Many scenes of mild, wacky, slapstick cartoon action violence. A significant plot element involves Eddie's brother having been killed by a toon. It is only described and not seen. We see the chalk outline of Marvin Acme's body. A heavy safe is seen as having crashed into the head of the outline. Acme's covered body is later seen being taken away on a gurney. The weasels brandish real guns. They also carry weapons that mirror their distinct personalities: ""Psycho"" wears a strait jacket and wields a straight razor; ""Greasy"" wields a dagger; ""Stupid"" wields a bat with a nail through it. An innocent, cute toon shoe is killed by being slowly lowered into dip and his pain is made very apparent. Eddie is an alcoholic and goes to a bar on several occasions where his girlfriend is a bartender. His heavy drinking throughout the film is contrasted by his decision not to drink before entering Toontown and he shoots his bourbon bottle (label clearly visible) with a Toon gun. There are many scenes with Eddie taking swigs of alcohol. His gun holster holds a bourbon bottle. A vintage neon Budweiser sign is visible in many shots in the bar. A man is seen passed out at the bar. Eddie is seen passed out at his desk with a bottle in his hand. A gag, not unlike the Bugs Bunny ""pronoun trouble"" gag, involves whether or not Roger wants a drink. Roger partakes of alcohol in two separate scenes, both with the same consequence. He loses control of himself as his head forms a steam whistle and he emits a high pitch that breaks all glass nearby. Baby Herman is often seen smoking a real cigar. In one scene, he throws a tantrum when he loses it. Children offer the main character cigarettes. One of the weasels named Wheezy has multiple cigarettes in his mouth at a time and is always surrounded by smoke. His hat also has multiple cigarette boxes in its brim. The villain Judge Doom is a complete psychopath, and his actions are very unpleasant. The main character Eddie Valiant is shown to suffer from severe PTSD, since his brother got killed by a Toon (who turns out to be the villain) and this leads Valiant to have a hatred on Toons, and as such, he's shown disgruntled and drinking heavily. The hyper-violent, frantically paced ""Maroon Cartoon"" at the very beginning of the film as child endangerment is at the root of many gags. Roger is electrocuted, set on fire, and pinned to the wall with knives to name a few situations in the cartoon. The violence in the cartoon is a send-up of violent cartoon gags such as those seen in Warner Bros and ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons. In a very disturbing scene, Judge Doom demonstrates what the ""dip"" does to toons by sticking a cute squeaking living toon shoe in it. That the shoe is executed only for demonstration purposes, and not for any crime is part of the unsettling nature of the scene. The dip kills toons and we see the shoe react in horror and hear its squeals of pain as it is lowered into a vat of dip. Once the shoe is dead, Judge Doom removes his gloved hand that held the red shoe from the vat of dip. The shoe's red paint drips off Doom's glove somewhat resembling blood. Eddie - who is not very fond of toons - and a Police Lieutenant are shown to be disturbed by this act. The high-energy Toontown sequence can be disturbing. 12 uses of ''damn'', 3 uses of ''hell'', 1 use of ''ass'' 1 use of ''bastard'' and 1 use of ''son of a bitch.'' One of the weasels is named ""Smart Ass"" which is seen in the credits A weasel says ""bullshtick"" which is a play on the word, ""bullshit."""

A dog barks at a boy and bites his shadow pulling it off. A boy fights with his shadow hitting it, dragging it and thumping it onto the floor. A parrot hisses and snaps at a fairy. A boy and a girl practice sword fighting. A dog slides into a group of men who toss paper in the air. A boy and a girl play-fight with wooden swords. Children fly through the air over a city and into the clouds. A fairy gets trapped in a drawer, a boy is poked in the eye by his telescope, and a girl falls down a slide. Children talk about a pirate ""clawing your belly,"" a boy says of mermaids ""they'll drown you if you get too close,"" a boy talks about a ""fairy falling dead."" A man yells and drags a dog by the collar. A fairy flies through a room knocking books down and tossing toys around. We see skeletons on a rock. Boys tackle a man and give him hugs. Brief shots of cups or bottles of alcohol; not a main feature. Wendy is at one point offered a drink or a cigar from a pirate, which she turns down. Hook is seen, briefly, with his ""Double Cigar"". Tinkerbell's poisoning is extremely emotional Mentions of non-explicit death and scenes of action, fighting, swords, and pirates. Scary-looking and sinister mermaids in the darkness. One intends to pull Wendy into the water, which Peter stops by suddenly coming forth close by Wendy, pushing her hand away while making an ugly, angry face and a loud hissing sound at the mermaid. The mermaid mimics this action back at Peter just before she dives back into the water. Hook and Peter fight in the air. During the fight, Hook taunts Peter by saying that Wendy will forget him when she grows up. That weakens Peter, and he nearly falls to his death. There is a sense of menace throughout the film. Both Hook's men and Peter's boys are perpetually afraid that their leader will kill them if they fail him. There are many small indirect threats beyond what is mentioned above (e.g. the point of Hook's hook is held very close to Smee's eyeball as Hook berates Smee). The worst you hear is ""Blast!"" or, from Hook, ""I'll cast anchor in you!"""

A Trio of surfers are looking at a surf magazine with a bikini-clad girl on the front, drooling over a photo. They show the picture, and it was just a surfboard There is violence but it's very very tame. The movie is about 3 teen/pre-teen boys who know martial arts fighting with adults, many of whom know martial arts as well. 3 young boys witness an attack on their grandfather. A babysitter is thrown into a closet with an entire pizza on her face. Kidnappers try to kidnap 3 boys but the boys defend themselves in a Home Alone like style, except kind of more violent like including throwing CDs at them and drugging them with laxative cola. We see the kidnappers run to the bathroom and then as they prepare to come out, the boys in one scene are grossed out by the smell. Tons of ninja fighting. A few scenes result in close calls of boys getting it. Very little if any blood Also a young boy picks a scab on his arm. A villain is shot. 5 ninjas come to attack an old man but 3 boys help defend him. A laxative is put in the ""bad guys"" drinks is not even remotely the same as drugging someone. 3 kids drug their captors coca cola soda with liquid laxative. The attack on the grandfather is meant to be very frightening/intense. Snyder the main villain is quite frightening to young viewers as he makes several graphical threats and screams a lot like (""I'll tear out your liver"" and ""I squeeze your head until slimy ooze comes out of eyes"" and ""I'll rip your heart out""). In one scene after being threatened the guy prays shaking, ""Please let me catch the kids"" None, only mild name calling such as stupid, and idiot."

A man is comically being shocked with electricity and falls on his knees in a vibrating motion (because of the shock) unintentionally cornering a woman against a wall, but has his head directly facing her breasts, which angers the woman because she thinks he's being vulgar. A woman talks of passion and thinks the man is being passionate when he knocks her to the floor. An old woman 'adopts' who she thinks is one of a man's many children, because her eyesight is terrible. At a wedding, when the man decides that he wants to marry the girl who went with the old woman, the old woman exclaims, ""Incest?!"", although she is not his child, but his former house maid. The father works in a funeral parlor. He talks about his troubles to the smiling corpse of an old man (the corpse is pale, but not graphic). The children play a trick on a nanny by pretending to eat a baby (they put baby socks on drumsticks, etc. while the real baby is hidden in a pot). A girl almost catapults a baby into a pot of boiling water. A man grabs an electrically charged doorknob and gets a shock. A child makes a science-experiment type of ""bomb"" out of green goo to ""blow up the cook"" who is tied to a table. A child hits an adult in the head with a pot.

A young boy is seen chopping a doll's head off with a miniature guilotine. We see wine at a wedding. During an episode of naughtiness, the children wreak havoc in the kitchen, including one child putting objects in a makeshift catapult that another child jumps on to fling the items across the kitchen and into a pot of boiling water. The children are put under a spell that speeds up their naughtiness out of their control, and they cannot stop themselves--the sleeping baby is put into the catapult at the last minute, but ends up not getting thrown. 2 mild obscenities (hell, bugger)."

The woman's bare breasts and crotch are seen, as is the man's penis, but none of that is photo realistic. Jim finds a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition magazine in Michael's room. A woman in her swimsuit, with some cleavage is visible, but nothing very explicit. After taking a key from a dead, decomposing body inside a casket, a father and daughter are attacked by the corpse itself after it rises from the dead, along with several other corpses who reanimate as well. They are fairly frightening in appearance for a PG movie, with sunken in faces and rotting flesh visible. Both the father and daughter escape unharmed after some peril. One corpse loses his head and another his arm during the scuffle. We see various ghosts, one of whom fires a pistol while another fires a crossbow where the arrow lands in another ghost's forehead rather than the apple on top of it (being a ghost, he's no worse for the wear). Some of Jim's clients have tropical drinks and offer to buy him one. When he asks for ginger ale, one says that's not a drink and orders three Volcanoes for them. A man is seen hanging himself in the beginning scene. Sara reacts to poison given to her by a ghost and appears to die (Jim and their kids see that). A ghostly ball of spiritual energy then goes into her body and lifts her up into some white light, eventually resurrecting her. Skeletons and dead bodies come to life and try to attack Jim & Megan. Sara is looking down an empty hallway, and Ramsey pops up behind her. Towards the end of the movie, Ramsley becomes irritated. Then he says ""Damn you, damn you all to hell"" and as he says ""hell"", his eyes very suddenly turn ice white and he falls into a fiery pit. Jim drops a candle light looks up at the mirror and sees his face in skeletal form. 1 use of oh my god and stupid 2 uses of damn and ass 1 paired with big 3 uses of hell and crap ""Hell"" and ""crap"" are each said 3 times whereas ""damn"" and ""ass"" are said twice.

The man is seen naked in a mirror but no nudity is shown to the viewers. The Nurse wears a cast-iron corset. A scene of bondage, but its played completely for laughs. No other overt sexual content is present. Dr Thorndyke is seen taking a shower. No nudity is shown. Two men punch each other up. A man dies from VERY loud music. We see blood dripping from his ears. A man is shot in the stomach, then in the head. Pretty graphic with some blood. A guy gets impaled on a piece of glass. Blood is seen on the shard. A woman falls out of a tower onto a beach. We see her hit the ground and roll into the ocean from a distance. Nothing worth noting. Even the most intense scenes in this movie are semi-comical at the least and hilarious at the most, however the shooting mentioned above and a pop-up scare at the end may take some by suprise. Again, this is a definate comedy by most standards. 1 use of bullshit , son of a bitch, crap, oh god and sucks 4 uses of oh my god On use of bulls-it. 1 S.O.B. Some sexual references.

There is a scene when Annie is wearing only her underwear and is trapped inside a freezer with Bruce. The scene fades out with the freezer light being turning off while Bruce holds and kisses Annie. There is a scene near the end with midgets running through a dressing room where many women are seen wearing underwear only. The midgets then proceed to a showering area where some nudity is present. A few occurrences where dwarfs touch women's breasts. There is a scene when Bruce is lying atop of Annie on her bed. She asks if it is his gun that she feels pressed against her, but it is implied that it is his penis when he remarks that his gun is in a shoulder holster. Several men are accidentally killed and their bodies are then stored in a freezer. Several dogs die. One character is shown drinking from a flask on multiple occasions. There is a party scene with wine consumption. One character always has a cigar in his mouth.  Mild profanity, at least one use of son of a *****.

We see a plane crash in flames. Bombers loom overhead and loud explosions roar in the background as the children run for cover. Edmund and Peter are knocked over by the force of one blast. In between those ""modern"" and ""ancient"" battles, Peter, Susan, Lucy and the Beavers are pursued through a tunnel by a pack of wolves, who at another time catch the fox and threaten to kill him. The children also cross a frozen river as the ice breaks beneath their feet and as a frozen waterfall begins to thaw and collapse above them. They are eventually cornered by the wolves, and they wind up falling into the raging torrent and being swept downstream. Later, Peter kills a wolf with his sword. (Again, no blood is seen, even though Aslan tells Peter to clean his blade.) Some of Aslan's soldiers attack the White Witch's encampment to free Edmund, swinging swords as the Witch's henchmen fight back. Ginarrbrik, the White Witch's evil dwarf, tackles Edmund and holds a knife to his throat. The Witch slaps Edmund, and Ginarrbrik raps him over the head with a pike. Characters grimace in pain as the White Witch turns them to stone. The professor smokes a pipe. A wolf very suddenly pounces on Edmund. Later a wolf barks/growls at Susan when she pulls a towel away revealing him, startling her. The ending is quite sad, yet uplifting. None."

None Jess thinks he sees the dark master running through the woods, and the figure dives at him, but it turns out to be his dad. Overall, a family film. There are scenes of bullying. Large sharp-toothed creatures (they look like wild dogs) surround a boy and a girl, and they lunge at them: the boy and the girl fight them off with sticks, a dog bites the tail of one creature, and the boy imagines having an iron glove on his hand and punches two of the creatures that are thrown into a tree. A boy sees a dark, shadowy figure moving close to him through a forest and he is frightened. Says ""damn"" like 7 times in a conversation between Jesse and his father."

A man is seen tearing his face apart. We see bloody chunks of flesh fall into a sink, and his completely mangled face is seen several times. A flash of light reveals that it was only a hallucination, and he is completely unharmed. A young girl is sucked screaming into a portal. Several decaying corpses and skeletons are seen towards the end of the film. A woman falls into a large hole filled with water were several skeletons appear. They are very grotesque looking. A woman is attacked by spirits and flung around a room. She is unharmed. A creepy clown doll pops out and attacks a child. It wraps its arm around his neck and strangles him, before dragging him under the bed. The child is able to get the upper hand and he escapes, tearing up the clown doll. A mouth-like portal tries to suck two children into it. They scream in terror, but are unharmed. The parents are seen smoking marijuana. They discover it in a drawer at home, and decide to smoke it together. It is implied that it was hidden there long ago and forgotten about; a remnant of the couple's younger ""hippie"" days rather than something they still do. Adults are seen drinking beers while watching a football game. Steve can be seen in Dr. Lesh's office with a cigarette that you never actually see him smoke. There are many prolonged sequences of strobing lights in this movie that may trigger seizures to people with photosensitive epilepsy or any other photosensitivity. Despite its supernatural theme. the film deals realistically with the distress of the parents and siblings at the disappearance of Carol Ann. One scene has a tree attacking and attempting to swallow a young boy. The tree crashes through a window and actually pulls the kid outside with its branches. A scene has a man hallucinating that he is pulling the skin and flesh off of his face. The bloody chunks fall into a sink. There is a jumpscare at the end of the film where a clown doll pops out from behind a boy and tries to strangle him. It is very sudden and frightening, and is seen by many as the scariest scene in the film, and one of the scariest scenes in cinema. One scene in a closet has a man angering a demonic spirit. The spirit's grotesque face manifests in the doorway. One scene has a woman trapped in an unfinished swimming pool and discovering that it is filled with rotting skeletons. One scene has a closet morph into a giant, mouth-like portal that tries to suck the children in. The ending scene has the family being blocked from leaving their home by coffins rising out of the ground and opening to reveal skeletons. Although no deaths are evident in the film, it has many scenes that place children in threatening conditions. Several scenes might also be considered too strong for the youngest audiences. One scene features scores of skeletons. A jump scene where a woman opens a door and a deafening shriek occurs, and another where a loud thunder and an explosion of wind comes down the stairs, knocking people to the floor. 2 uses of hell 7 uses of Shit 3 uses of Son of a Bitch 1 use of Bastard"

She is frequently dressed in thin, clingy fabrics which show off her figure revealingly, and her nipples are often prominent. A woman watches a man approach a married woman and caress her clothed breasts from behind (the man may or may not be the woman's husband). Two women overhear a man and woman having sex offscreen (we hear the woman moaning). Two cars collide and a woman injures her head (we see her being taken to a hospital). A man and a woman argue, he throws a glass, shattering it, and grabs the woman as she tries to run up a staircase; she frees herself, he falls, and she locks herself in a room. A woman cuts her finger with a kitchen knife (a little blood is visible) and then stabs a robotic woman in the stomach (she does not bleed). A woman hits a man over the head with a fireplace poker (blood sprays onto a chair and we see blood on his forehead). A man chases a woman through several rooms; the woman enters a room where a robotic double of herself approaches her menacingly while clutching panty hose (it is implied that the woman is killed and replaced by the robotic double). Adult characters drink and smoke cigarettes in several scenes; a man appears in a presumably intoxicated state in a few scenes. The whole film has a very creepy tone do to the lack of music and the faint ambient, off-kilter score. The whole movie can be quite intense and creepy.

Passing joke about ""Playmate of the month."" The Russian sub's political officer is murdered (death is shown onscreen) in a quick struggle with the captain, but no blood or gore is part of the scene. The shot where tries to breathe, but can't because his neck is broken, can be a little disturbing. Two people get shot with a pistol and show blood stains on their chest and shoulder. One of them dies. Not very gory. Jack shoots a bad guy, but they don't show the bad guy going down. No drugs. Very brief drinking in scenes of meetings between politicians/diplomats, but alcohol is not the focus of such scenes. The Russian engineer smokes cigarettes and offers one to Jack Ryan when he boards the Russian sub. Jack accepts it, but turns green and starts coughing and they all laugh. This is a key plot point to establish trust between the Russians and Americans, as Ryan had previously stated that he didn't smoke.. Most of the film feels very intense. Nothing too serious, though. Name of ""Jesus"" is sworn Phrases: ""Jesus, you look like hell"", ""big son of a bitch"", ""no shit"", ""write a goddamn memo"", ""you son of a bitch"", ""Jesus that's a big sucker"", ""a goddamn cook"", ""goddamnit"", ""goddamn thing's made to start a war"", ""coming out their asses"", ""turn that goddamn wheel"", ""what the hell is this"", ""hell brakes loose"", ""damnit bill"". 6 uses of ""goddamn"", 2 uses of ""ass"". 1 use of Shit A few uses of Hell, Damn, and Ass Three uses of Son of a Bitch One use of Bastard"

Abigail is obviously nude but her body is obscured by the door. The conversation they have can be seen as suggestive as Ben describes that his father believes that Ben has been ""cavalier."" Ben and Abigail arrive at his father's house to which Ben tells his Dad, ""I'm in trouble."" to which Ben's dad says, referring to Abigail, ""Is she pregnant?"" (She isn't, but she later asks why Ben's dad assumed THAT.) Main female character wears a dress through much of the movie that shows a good amount of cleavage. No Sex shown, No Nudity, references Only. As Abigail is typing the access code to a room, her co worker is seen standing behind her admiring her figure as she is wearing a pencil skirt and heels. Later Abigail and other women wear evening gowns. A flare falls on gunpowder causing a giant fiery explosion. Two partially decomposed bodies and a skeleton are seen. A rickety catwalk gives way, causing a man to fall into a seemingly bottomless abyss. Ian and his men unleash frequent flurries of gunfire and threaten peoples lives, but there are no casualties. A lit flare ignites a mans sleeve. Goons temporarily disable a guard by shooting him with a taser. Ben draws blood by pricking his thumb with a knife, and later knocks a pursuer out cold. And what would a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced movie be without wild chases, explosions and cars bashing through barriers? A bunch of gunfire erupts in a cemetery, although nobody is hit, several graves are desecrated A scene at a ""gala"" shows people drinking wine and champagne. Also, during a scene in which Ian and his men are deciphering the riddle, Shaw is briefly shown drinking a beer. One of the clues is involved using a pipe. Ian repeatedly threatens people with a gun. A lit flare causes gunpowder to ignite, and a ship explodes with two men inside it, but they save themselves by going into the ship's cargo hold. Numerous scenes may be very intense and/or frightening for some people because of all the action and violence. In a car chase, a woman is being held hostage and to save herself and her item, she hangs on to the back door of a van which swings and she barely misses being scraped by a bus. Abigail used the German profanity ""verdammt"", which is German for ""damn it"", to which Riley remarks ""pretty sure she was swearing"". Shaw also uses ""damn"" after Ben escapes with the Declaration of Independence in the Archives preservation room. Ian uses the English profanity bloody. There are just over a half-dozen interjections of my god, oh my lord, for gods sake, etc. One of the security guards in the film is named ""Mike Hawk"", which, when said quickly can be lewd"

Some minor bleeding of the characters, but nothing significant. A semi-intense Car Chase scene that includes gunfire. Nobody is killed in this scene. There is a brief scene where Mitch pulls a knife on the Abigail, but no one is harmed. Nicolas Cage pretends to be drunk in one scene, and applies drinking alcohol on his tongue, and on his neck. There is a party scene (Presidential birthday party) where alcohol is being served, but is very subtle. Some younger kids may not get the plot.

Blood shows up on a Telmarine general's lip after Miraz socks him in the face. And it spreads across Caspian's hand when the hag slashes it. Most often, though, when swords are plunged into bodies, they don't come out sheathed in red. But the point here is that swords are plunged into bodies. Repeatedly. As are crossbow bolts, arrows and knives. The fighting evokes images of ethnic cleansing as Telmarines seek to eradicate the Narnians from their own land. Defending the assault, Miraz hisses, ""They've been breeding like cockroaches under a rock."" A soldier's head is severed at one point. It's swift and not overly graphic, but we do see a helmet-clad orb roll away from the body. A minotaur is pushed off a high castle balcony, and the camera never blinks as he tumbles, crashes into a bulwark, then thuds to the ground, presumably dead. Equally intense is a scene in which another minotaur holds up a descending gate to allow his comrades to escape. The Telmarines riddle his body with arrows and he collapses, the gate slamming down on top of him. The remaining Narnians are trapped and await their doom. Huge catapults hurl boulders at the Narnians' makeshift fortress, blasting walls, bringing down doorways, etc. A ploy by the Narnians to collapse the earth underneath their enemies' feet succeeds, and we see dozens of horses and riders fall into the pit that's created. Trees awaken and wipe out sections of armored men and animals with their flailing roots and limbs. The river-goddepicted as water that coalesces into the rough form of a manrips a bridge from its tethers and destroys everyone on it. Hand-to-hand combat also gets front-and-center attention. Peter and Caspian violently cross swords before they discover they're on the same side. Caspian puts a sword to his uncle's throat, forcing him out of bed. And Peter takes on Miraz in an interminable and armor-denting test of superiority. Then, when Peter refuses to kill his fading opponent, one of Miraz's generals finishes the man off. (We see his body crumple with an arrow sticking out of it.) The dwarf Trumpkin is bound and gagged in a boat, then thrown overboard to drown. When Peter's shoulder is dislocated, Edmund wrenches it back into place. For a moment, Susan dangles (frighteningly) over a high ledge. In England, Peter gets into a frivolous fight with another boy. They push, shove, hit and kick.  As the four Pevencies are in Narnia at the beginning, they find out that their friends from the previous film are all gone. This can be really upsetting. Soldiers surround a bed and all shoot, intending to kill its occupant Hideous animals emerge from a dark opening and one calls up the spirit of the witch. An animal cuts Caspian's hand with a knife and it bleeds. The witch tries to coax Caspian into giving her a drop of Adam's blood. Intense battle action throughout. Idiot and Shut Up"

A moderately bloody scene of a man hanging by his limbs from a tree. None. Although there is a scene of people treading grapes, presumably to make wine.

Count Olaf attempts to force Violet(who is a minor) to marry him in an attempt to steal the money from the orphans. This movie does not contain blood or gore; however, there are some dark and disturbing elements. Its plot focuses on an old man trying to kill children. At the beginning of the movie it is implied that two people died in a burning house; the death is discussed throughout the movie. An old man is comically abusive towards three children and puts them in peril throughout the movie. The back of a dead body sitting in a chair can be seen. An old man makes several attempts to kill people including children (and successfully kills one man and allows a woman to die). An old man violently slaps a young boy. An old man blackmails a young girl, saying that he will kill her baby sister if she doesn't go through with marrying him. Some alcohol and tobacco consumption. This film and Barnyard are by far the darkest and scariest Nickelodeon films, due to the appearances of Count Olaf and Dag the Coyote. This movie focuses on an old man trying to kill some children in order to get their fortune. It is extremely dark, and includes many potentially disturbing themes such as death, suicide, murder, forced marriage, pedophilia, and more. Throughout the movie, children are often in danger. A scene involves them being trapped in a car on a railway with a train coming. Another intense scene, set during a storm, involves many flying, falling household items that put the children in peril of death. Carnivorous leeches attack a small wooden rowboat. Being leeches, they are not frightening, but they have sharp teeth. There is a ""jump"" moment in which a snake pops out of its cage, hissing. 3 ""damns,"" and a few uses of ""arse.""

A girl kicks a boy off monkey bars; he falls and hits his face on the floor but is fine. A robot boy twists a girl's arm; then the girl punches the presumably metallic robot and her hand hurts. She then head-butts it, but just falls to the ground and her head now hurts. A man throws another man through a window, a man punches a window out and a man punches another in the face.

A robot girl lifts a boy over her head and spins him round and round. She then throws him down a corridor. He tries to tackle her but she shrugs him off with superhuman force, sending him sliding backwards. A robot boy tackles a girl, and a robot girl punches a pillar and damages it. A boy tries to do the same and he just causes himself pain (no injury). A robot girl lifts a boy by the neck and regards him sneeringly..

This may go over younger viewers' heads. When Shrek discovers that a true love's kiss will break Rumpelstiltskin's spell, Donkey refuses. When the Dragon appears, Shrek tells Donkey to ""woo her."" When Shrek arrives in the alternate universe, he falls to the ground really hard and implies that ""he thinks he fell on his keys"". A witch gets melted by being splashed by water. In the alternate timeline Puss eats Gingerbread Man, then says to Shrek ""Oh, were you going to eat that?"" Played for laughs. The Gingerbread Man is forced to fight animal crackers for entertainment and breaks them into pieces with a lollipop. Ogres drink eyeball cocktails and at one point Donkey amuses them by putting eyeballs in his nostrils. Repeated comical violence including fighting and imprisonment. The film's climactic battle could be viewed as intense and/or excessive by some young viewers. Shrek and Fiona fight during training, both punching and hitting each other. The ogres of the resistance drink cocktails with eyeballs in them. Shrek glows gold when he realizes his entire life is gone. At his triplet's birthday party, Shrek is under pressure too many times, and has an emotional outburst doing his famous ""Shrek"" roar. After Shrek is done scaring the villagers, he discovers wanted posters for Fiona in the forest. He quickly goes from being happy to being worried as he senses that something is wrong. This scene is very ominous and is followed by Shrek discovering his swamp burned down and his home abandoned/deserted. Rumplestiltskin waves around a glass of water subtly threatening to melt witches with it if they don't tell him a good plan to stop Shrek from getting a curse-breaking true love's kiss. When one witch suggests getting a bounty hunter, Rumpel gets excited and accidentally melts her with water, then shrugs it off. The complete disappearance of Fiona's parents and the partial disappearance of Shrek may upset and confuse younger viewers. The battle scene at the end is quite intense. 1 use of ass and mild name calling throughout. Donkey says ""hell no"" when asked to use his tongue to help clean Puss."

A bra is shown being lit on fire with a torch. A character is name Puss, and the word ""puss"" is heard many times throughout the film, but it is merely a cat's name, but not a vulgar slang term. Doris said Prince Charming made her ""hotter than July."" When Fiona moved a statue, it looked like a frog was kissing a horse's butt. Fiona discussed having baby ogres with Shrek. When they left for the boat, Puss said goodbye to mutiple cats he was in love with, and he had many girlfriends. A boy's nose bleeds twice in the film. When Merlin eats some small rocks, his teeth are shown with blood on them. Shrek accidentally kills a man off screen. Played for laughs. Shrek accidentally pushes a ship and sends it sailing. He tries to stop the ship by throwing a glass bottle at it, but it only makes the ship sink. The people on the ship then jump into the water. This is played for laughs. Shrek has an infant-induced nightmare, where newborn ogre babies are crashing things, but are not hurt, but this scene can scare many kids. A stampede of them chase Shrek. See Frightening and Intense scenes for more. Part of Shrek's stuffy and stiff royal costume pops off and hits Donkey. That sets off a comedy-based chain reaction of chaos where various things or characters accidentally smash into other things or characters, including a small fire breaking out. Overall fighting and slapstick throughout the film. A drug trip is implied. Two stoned teenage boys are shown on a campus when they exit a carriage. Two teenage boys posed as ""stoners"" and had smoke coming out of their ""hippie"" van and said, ""Don't burn all my frankincense and myrrh!"" Shrek's baby nightmare sequence may frighten younger viewers, however it is more comical than truly frightening. Some little kids might think ogres are scary. Final Note: A family film overall, but families with older kids and some teenagers might appreciate it more. Like all Shrek films, some mild obscenities are going to be heard throughout the film. Puss is used many times, but it is the name of a cat. Gross out humor (ex. Baby ogre vomiting on Shrek's face in his nightmare). At least 2 poop jokes. Donkey called Puss a fool. ""Loser"" was mentioned. Lame, stupid, idiot, jerk, stinkhole, dork, and cowards were used."

Shrek and Fiona kiss a few times. ""Sexy"" is used to refer to several things over the course of the film. Donkey innocently mentions getting Shrek out of some clothes. A group of women then gasp suggestively. implied kissing between charming and Doris A person adds ""Lust"" to a magical potion, but pours a massive amount in it. The big, bad wolf read a Pork Illustrated magazine with a drawing of a pig in a bikini on the cover, and it was probably a parody of porny magazines. The Fairy Godmother's song Holding Out for a Hero had some mild innuendos in the lyrics. Donkey told Puss to get his ""cat cheeks"" out of his face when they were locked up in a treasure chest box. Donkey yelled at Puss and said, ""If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call!"" When Shrek passes out from drinking the Happily Ever After potion, he falls and lands on Puss. This is played for laughs. When Shrek needs Donkey to cry, Puss sneaks up on Donkey and violently stomps on his hoof. Donkey then screams in pain and cries a tear. Shrek and the king fight by arguing and throwing food Puss in Boots prances at and jumps on Shrek, digging at him with his claws (no blood). Donkey tries to kick the cat, but instead gets Shrek in the crotch, doubling him over in pain (and he makes a verbal reference to being hit in the testicles). After Fiona throws the mermaid back into the ocean, two large sharks are seen immediately going after her. Mainly slapstick/cartoon fantasy violence throughout. There is a battle towards the end of the movie (sword fighting and bow and arrows are fired) though no one seems seriously hurt. Puss in Boots is caught with catnip in his possession (an innuendo for weed). When Puss was going through the potions, some of them were named after common medicines. Men enter a bar on multiple occasions. Fairy godmother is making potions in the factory (complete with dark shadows and red light). 1 use of ass and mild name calling throughout. 4 uses of bloody Puss told Donkey, ""You still look like an ass to me."""

She stares into the area of his crotch, and says ""woof"" with delight. He lies on top of her, and we see him moving as they groan and moan, and she begins to sing (sex is implied). A few minutes later the movie cuts back to the Monster and woman, as the woman begs him to have sex with her again. A man and woman lie in bed, the camera cuts away and we hear the woman moaning and singing (it is implied they are having sex) We see a man and a woman descending on a platform lying together with sheets covering them (it is implied they had sex and we see their bare chests and arms) A man kisses a woman's chest and clothed breast, she pulls him off and says they should wait to have sex until they're married A man and a woman kiss and she says ""No tongues"" A woman wears a skimpy nightgown (cleavage is visible) and dances seductively for a man A woman kisses a man's hand, then claps it to her clothed breast and makes a suggestive remark about them having sex A woman accuses a man of bragging about having sex with her A man leans in to kiss a woman and she stops him In nearly every scene she appears, a woman wears a dress or nightgown that reveals significant cleavage A man says to another man ""Let me know if you need any help with the girls"" (implying sex) A woman comments on a man's endowment On two occasions, a woman misinterprets a man's comments as sexual advances We see a man's body dangling from a rope after being hung (a bag is over his head) and later see him being buried A blind man accidentally lights a monster's thumb on fire (we see the flesh burning), he groans in pain and runs away, breaking through a door The monster grabs a man around the throat and chokes him for an extended period of time, a woman injects the monster with a sedative and he releases the man (he appears unharmed afterwards); the monster grabs a man's throat and raises him off the ground while choking him A man grabs another man by the throat and chokes him.

A man describes dissecting a brain during class A police officer very dramatically lights a cigar and smokes it. A man takes several drinks of alcohol while talking to a police officer. The monster is served wine and a cigar but doesn't use either. A man smokes a cigarette while laying in a bed with a woman. A man and woman smoke cigarettes together. Some smoking cigars/cigarettes and drinking. The creation of the monster is somewhat frightening. Some characters act crazy or menacingly. The angry mob may be frightening to some viewers. The film has a somewhat dark tone but is meant to be humorous. Digging up a dead body from a grave may be difficult for some viewers. In the climax, it's momentarily unclear if one of the main characters is alive or dead. Although intended to be humorous, the monster may frighten young children. By the end of story, the monster is made intelligent and articulate to the point where he calms and befriends a threatening mob through his eloquence. 'B*tch' is said is said once. 'D*mn' is said. 'B*stard' is said twice. 'H*ll' is said. 'Jesus Christ' is said. 'Godd*mn' is said once. 'Sh*t' is said once and mild scatological terms are said twice.

There's a scene in which the three main characters are hunted by a big, menacing owl, which could be very scary to smaller children. The scene where Michelle finds her parents dead might be frightening to smaller children. For the majority of the film, the main characters believe everyone who lives in their forest home, including their parents, are dead. In spite of the cover of the video, this movie is know for some thematic elements in a G rated film of its time. If theatrically released today, it would have earned a PG rating, as it is sadly unsettling. None.

Grandpa Joe mentions ""Being cut to ribbons"" however, this never happens. In his office Wonka is seen with a cigar Grandpa Joe mentions giving up tobacco. Willy Wonka says: ""liquor is quicker"". During the boat tunnel scene, Wonka sings an eerie sounding song as various scary images are projected on the walls whilst all the passengers are very frightened. Charlie and Grandpa Joe are almost violently killed by an exhaust fan. They narrowly escape. A child falls through a chute that leads to the incinerator. Her father jumps in after her.

A man's belt is removed from his pants, his underwear is shown, although it is played for laughs In a brief scene, the beast can be seen naked in the tub. Humorous, but not sexual. Gaston constantly pursues Belle to marry him which she tells him no and at one time threatens to send her father to an insane asylum as bribery. This may be seen as sexual harassment by some viewers. Some of Belle's dresses reveal a hint of cleavage. 3 women wear dresses that show off their large breasts, and they act flirtatiously around Gaston. When Gaston lifts them up in the air and drops them on LeFou, you can briefly see their undergarments. Gaston rips his shirt open to reveal his hairy chest. A wolf is thrown against a tree, if you listen closely you can hear what sounds like bones breaking. While Belle is treating his wound from being attacked by the wolves the Beast cries out in pain and the two start arguing. The baker's wife whacks him with a rolling pin in the opening song it's played out in a comedic way. Gaston shoots a bird that falls to the ground, presumably dead. Cogsworth is burned by Lumiere twice. manhandled by Maurice and run over with a tea cart. In each case, he doesn't suffer any long-term damage. Beast has several wounds after fighting with a pack of wolves. Some blood is briefly shown on his arm. Several moments of violence in a group battle scene between the villagers and castle objects. Mrs. Potts and the cups pour hot water on a villager. Le Fou threatens Lumiere with a torch, before Cogsworth stabs him in the rear. A feather duster has many feathers plucked out, until Lumiere burns the villager and saves her. Much of this scene is intended as comical. Two characters engage in a long fight to the death In the Be Our Guest scene, there are singing beer steins that have froth coming out of their mouths, as well as dancing wine glasses and champagne bottles that shoot open like fireworks. There are some brief references to beer in the bar and characters are seen with full beer mugs. During the ""Gaston"" song in the bar, the villagers sing about how no one ""takes shots"" like Gaston. Gaston fires three bullets from his gun into a barrel of an alcoholic beverage, it spills out, and some men fill their cups with it. Despite having a G rating the movie has some surprisingly violent scenes that may be unsettling for younger audiences. The ""Beauty and the Beast"" song at the end credits is somewhat sad. The Beast and Belle get into an argument while she is treating his wound from being attacked by the wolves. They raise their voices at eachother. Maurice becomes very ill and Gaston threatens to send him to a mental asylum if Belle refuses to marry him. Some young children might be frightened by The Beast in his early scenes. The cursed castle is decorated with statues of horned demons, snakes and the like to give the castle a gothic setting.

In dialogue, there are some violent threats about removing people's eyeballs to wear as earrings, pulling out teeth to use for necklaces, cutting off someone's head filling it with food and giving it to the dogs. These threats are not carried out. There are multiple scenes involving mild slapstick violence, all played for laughs. The Baron makes multiple attempts to murder his wife including shooting at her with a gun and nearly impaling her with a falling stake. Several dogs invade a factory, knocking people and vats of liquid over. One bites a man on the butt. The Baron's ship shoots cannonballs at the heroes in their car but nobody gets hit. Two men are tossed out of an airship into the sea. They cry out that they will drown but are later shown to have reached shore safely. The climax in which the children revolt against the Baron and his court involves a lot of slapstick such as guards slipping on wine, the Baron getting lifted into the air by a hook etc. No one is injured but a lot of people scream. Smoking and drinking takes place at the king's birthday party, it is seemed to suggest that some members may be drunk. A man talks about burning an old car that two children play on in great detail. He then snidely remarks that if they don't be quiet, he'll murder them (it is said more comically than threateningly) A car is shown driving off a cliff with four people in it, falling towards the sea for several seconds.

To which his adoptive father teaches him a lesson by banishing Mowgli to his room for the rest of the day to reflect on his wrongdoings and says he won't get any dinner either. We see Shere Khan's shadow as the tiger moves through the village looking for Mowgli (as everyone sleeps and with some ominous music playing). The men are finally alerted and then come at the tiger with spears and torches (the tiger jumps out of the village). Various humans then cross a river and head into the forbidden jungle at night.

Typical old-fashioned cigar smoking. Mr. Banks is summoned to the bank after hours and he knows that he is likely about to be fired for his son inadvertently starting a bank run that embarrassed the institution. There is a long sequence of Mr. Banks walking to the bank in the darkened streets of London and feeling utterly lost and alone convinced that he is a failure who is about ruin his family. One of the musicians during the ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" sequence appears to resemble a stereotypical Asian, which may offend viewers. An old woman covered in ashes scares two children in a dark alleyway, but nothing very frightening. Shortly after, a viscous dog also threatens the children growling, though only momentarily. At one point, the Banks children get lost in the slums of the East End of London, and run into a soot-covered man who appears to be abducting them, but he turns out to be their trusted friend, Bert, who takes them safely home.

Innuendo: A reporter asks if McQueen was in a magazine called ""Cargirl,"" which is a spoof of Playgirl. Sally has a ""tramp stamp"" style tattoo on her bumper. Lightning makes a tongue in cheek remark about it. There's a scene where Lightning accidentally walks in on the Sheriff getting his undercarriage checked. Possibly a reference to a ""prostate exam"" or a ""colonoscopy."" In a nightmare sequence, we see Chick Hicks get chopped up by Frank. In the opening race, Chick Hicks causes a huge pileup with the other racers in an attempt to stop Lightning from beating him. Lightning makes it through the wreck effortlessly, but a lot of the racers involved in the wreck are badly injured, with one of the cars being really crumpled up and leaking oil. Most of this is played for laughs though. While all characters are vehicles, they do some pretty raucous like hit each other, careening off walls, trees, cones, tires and crash. In a dream, Lightning imagines himself as a jet fighter firing rockets at advancing War of the Worlds-like alien machines, which explode when hit by his weaponry, in his own movie, ""Lightning Storm"". lightning says that racecars don't need headlights since the road is always lit, another automobile replies ""so is brother but he still needs headlights"", could be a drug reference. The VW Bus is presumed to be on the drugs throughout the movie. He's this movies interpretation of a stereotypical hippy from the 60's and 70's. Many scenes that take place at night are a bit frightening. Nothing majorly concerning; this is a very kid-friendly film and the only thing that would likely bother parents is the language and possibly one innuendo.

Captain Hook smokes The part where Jane harshly tells her baby brother, Daniel, about Peter Pan and Neverland are nothing but ""childish nonsense"" during a heated argument as he becomes heartbroken earlier in the film is really upsetting. If you were in Wendy's position, you'd be sorry for him. Tinkerbell is having a few strokes and heart attacks after Jane's disbelief in fairies. Set in WWII, London during the Blitz we hear the sounds of warfare (bombings) and see the results of that (bombed out and/or burning buildings), but don't actually see any such warfare in person.

This is the case for all mermaids featured in the film. There is a scene where Ariel is given a bath. While no private parts are seen, it is clear she is fully nude. When Ariel is first given legs, she is clearly nude from the waist down. Her buttocks appear on camera for a split second but it's very hard to notice since she swims away super quickly. After Flounder and Sebastian get the now-human Ariel to the surface, her buttocks are briefly visible again when she takes her first breath. Also later when Ariel tries to stand up in the shallow water, there's a brief view of the side of her buttocks. Ursula's breasts often bounce. In one shot, she shakes them and the camera zooms in on them. Ursula tells Ariel to use body language to attract her man, and dances sensually, by moving her hips. Before, she was using a sensual dance move when a woman moves their shoulders to move her breasts. Ariel begins to transform into a sea polyp and her shell bra disappears. In one brief shot, her breasts are bare, with her arm covering her nipples. Her bra reappears once she transforms back into a human. When Ursula turns into a human to seduce Prince Eric in one shot she rubs one of her breasts against his arm while cuddling him. At Ursula and Eric's wedding birds fly under Ursula's dress making it fly up giving a split second view of her panties. Blood is briefly present during the song ""Les Poissons"". After being turned into a human, Ariel begins to drown. A shark snaps and chomps as it chases Ariel and her fish-friend Flounder. A storm throws a ship onto rocks and the ship catches fire and later explodes. A dog onboard is endangered briefly. The prince nearly drowns. The sea king destroys Ariel's treasures in a fit of rage. The sea witch transforms mer-people into anthropomorphic sea polyps. Ursula momentarily grabs a detached human tongue and throws it into her cauldron. Grimsby lights a pipe. Ariel thinks it's a musical instrument and blows soot all over his face. The shipwreck sequence can be frightening. A shark attacks without injury to any characters. The scene in which the sea king destroys Ariel's treasures can be frightening. Ariel's transformation into a human can be disturbing. Ghostly hands enter her mouth and take her voice. The sea witch laughs maniacally. In a rapidly cut scene, her tail fin is split and turned into legs. She is then left to drown before being saved by her friends. The cursed creatures (sea polyps) might be frightening. ""Idiot"" is heard once"

Budding romance with Flik and Atta. The character Francis is a ladybug who often plays in drag, and is mistaken for being a female by two flies. This becomes a recurring joke throughout the rest of the film. Hopper grabs Dot by her head and attempts to feed her to a grasshopper. P.T. Flea is burnt by a fiery explosion, but he survives and it is played for comedic effect. While a bird is chasing the band of bugs, a rock falls on Francis breaking his leg (he is later seen with a cast), and a second rocks falls on his head knocking him unconscious. Hopper crushes three grasshoppers to death by launching mounds of grains on them as they scream in terror. Grasshoppers reveal they will ""squish"" the ant queen. A grashopper chases Dot through a field of thistles, and one of the spiky flowers is launched towards him and he squeals. Bugs spread red berry-juice on themselves to trick other bugs into thinking they're mutilated. (Played for laughs). Some bugs pull out Hopper's antenna. A grasshopper hits Flik several times, beating him with a broomstick After a rainstorm interrupts that, Hopper grabs Flik by the neck and starts to strangle him for fooling him with a fake bird, but a real bird comes along, grabs Hopper and feeds him to its babies. Some young bugs draw a mural that portrays a lot of blood (including a severed caterpillar). In a bar that Flik enters, it is suggested the customers (who are bugs) are drinking alcoholic beverages, like madiera. He slurps it fast, and crashes a car into a mailvan. Hopper and other grasshoppers have menacing appearances, along with their meanspirited disposition and treatment of the ants. Dim is portrayed as a raging monster. The scene ends when he is accidentally hurt and starts crying. Dot, being chased by the grasshoppers, appears to have been beaten about 100 times.

The two main characters share a kiss. The chickens use a shower to hide. Nude buttocks are seen when two hens are dating in a shower cabinet. Fowler describes Americans as being 'oversexed'. The chickens use a pair of underpants as a tail for their escape plane. A man is ""goosed"" by his wife at one point (accompanied by a cartoonish horn sound effect), but there is little attention drawn to it and it goes no further onscreen. A hen is carried by her neck and gets beheaded off-screen. A woman gets thrown off a golf buggy. Mrs Tweedy kicks her husband in the backside. He is later seen with a footprint in the spot where it happened. Rocky is knocked out with a black eye in a fight, with one eye popped out, laying on the floor. Very graphic but only seen for two seconds. (He himself is on the floor, his eye stays in its socket.) A rooster is comically slapped in the face by a chicken. A bad character constantly has accidents with a pie machine. An empty tobacco pipe is used as a trumpet, then later as a horn. It later is recycled for a shower head when a shower breaks. A chicken takes a bottle of duffbeer and slams the shower door. Rocky and Ginger are seen binge-drinking. Later on, they crash a car into a van. A very brief joke about a cocktail, when a character is drinking water in a posh fashion. A brawl is started, with shouting and screaming for their lives. One of the two mice says ""Bloomin' Hell"".

His naughty bits are obscured by shower steam. A robot dog asks his creator to make him a female poodle companion. When the parents are transported to the alien ship, one man had been sitting on the toilet (he's still seated with his pants around his ankles as he floats through the air toward the ship. One of the ships that the children build is shaped like buttocks and one scene shows something being positioned for insertion. Most of the aliens in this movie look like green, slimy slugs swimming in egg-shaped glass containers that have a metal plate with pointed teeth. An alien eats a furry creature. As a punishment, an alien is sucked out into space through a large tube. A large alien in an egg-shaped container begins to hatch, blowing off the top of the egg and poking three tentacled eyes out of the hole and pushing two large scaled claws out of the bottom (when we see the whole alien it resembles a chicken with pointed teeth in its beak, a large slimy tongue, tiny wings and dragon-like legs). The chicken-alien pecks at humans lined up at its feet (once getting its beak stuck in a stage floor). A group of alien ships fly into the sun and explode. A group of children are chased by alien spaceships and are fired upon. A ship flies into the chicken-alien's head, it wobbles and falls on top of some other aliens. A huge stadium is filled with cheering aliens when a group of humans is marched out and prepared for sacrifice. A group of children fight with some aliens; one alien is kicked and crashes into a wall, another is sprayed with asthma spray and flies into a wall, and another explodes when a walkman is turned up really loud. A group of children in spaceships fly through a meteor shower and are pummeled by flaming meteors. A boy beats up some guards with a spear-like weapon. A boy enlarges himself, blows on a ship and it flies backward and blows up. A boy is tasered. A robot dog is strapped to a table and an alien scientist prepares to disassemble him. A boy in an aircraft crashes through a bell tower, bounces on rooftops and into a roof knocking the chimney off a house, which crumbles onto a car. A boy is ejected from a flying aircraft and his parachute gets entwined in a tree leaving him dangling upside down. Two boys and a robot dog fly very fast trying to leave the atmosphere, the engines die and the aircraft plummets toward the Earth. A robot dog explodes blowing up an alien guard and blowing open a cell door, and a robot dog explodes leaving shrapnel and a crater in the floor. A boy flies with a rocket pack through traffic after bouncing off a few walls. A boy flies with a rocket pack around a room crashing into walls, dragging a woman along with him and setting the curtains on fire. A boy throws a toaster into the air and it flies back and hits him on the head. A robot dog bites an alien's arm and he's taken away to be ""torn apart."" Children are locked in a dark dungeon and we see alien rodents skittering along pipes. A ""girl-eating plant"" with really large pointed teeth snaps at a girl when it is left outside her door, and takes a bite out of a picture of a girl. A boy bouncing in a bubble crashes into a tree and splatters goo all over himself. A boy miniaturizes himself and the shrink ray gadget falls on him. A boy sprays his asthma inhaler into his eyes and yells. A woman is miniaturized by a shrink ray and is threatened by a huge worm coming out of an apple (the worm has a large round mouth full of rows of pointed teeth); the woman uses a pencil to defend herself. An amusement park ride has glowing red eyes and a mouth with big teeth as its entrance; there are apparently flames inside. We see an alien skeleton chained to a dungeon wall. Children carrying torches walk zombie-like toward a boy. Humans are shown with mind control devices attached to their heads. Children panic and begin to cry when they realize that there is no one around to make their ouchies, owies and tummy aches feel better. A pie fight breaks out in a restaurant and many kids get pies in the face. A robot programmed to dress a boy gives him a wedgie when putting his pants on, and a robot ties a boy's shoes together so when he tries to walk he falls flat on the floor. A robo-dog passes nuts and bolts on a doorstep, a boy lifts the robot dog's tail and sprays foam on a fire. A boy vomits on an amusement park ride (we don't see any goo, just hear the sounds.) A boy makes a reference to urinating in the shower. We travel through a boy's ear canal and into his brain and see electrical flashes a couple of times. A boy, woman, man and dog burp very loudly a few times. after the party in RetroLand without parents, in the morning, when Jimmy is having a headache and stomach pain, Nick said ""...I remember my first time"", could be innocent for kids but it has an alcohol reference for adults None. This is a G rated film. The scene that involves the meteor shower can be quite intense for young children. A monstrous chicken-like creature has three eyes (and that of a close-up view of the inside of its mouth/throat). Carl mourns at a alien skeleton while in the dungeon, then gets frightened by a spider that just shows up. There are a few scenes involving separation and grieving over the loss of parents, which may upset some viewers. In one scene, before Nick finishes his ""scary story"", a kid suddenly jumps in front of him out of nowhere. this could cause a few jump scares. During the credits shows us what happend to Jimmy's teacher Ms. Fowl after he shrunk her in the beginning of the movie. She is seen riding a worm to the cafeteria A caterpillar from the first film. When Miss Fowl accidentally gets shrunk by Jimmy's shrink ray the Caterpillar tried to eat her An anatomical reference, exclamations like ""holy cow pie"" and ""we're gonna kick some alien buttocks.""

A mother and small boy in a car nearly run head-on into a van on a narrow winding road. A five-year-old boy uses matches to light a candle three times and burns his finger once and yells ""Ouch!"" A mother leaves her 5-year-old son and his same-aged female playmate home alone late at night and the boy becomes afraid when the mom does not return. A boy and girl (both 5 years old) walk through a long, dark tunnel and halfway through she begins to turn into a fish and collapses; the boy cries, and carries her out to the shoreline, and he dunks her in the water to revive her (she awakens). Several short scenes feature family arguments: A husband and his wife argue over the phone and by signal beacon, and she slams the phone down and later slams a pot of greens into a sink. A girl-fish argues several times with her human father about living on land and he locks her in a bubble; she escapes, and this is repeated three times. An old woman in a nursing home screams when a little boy shows her a goldfish with the face of a little girl; the old woman screams that it is bad luck and the fish must go back to the sea. Several scenes depict dark-blue, big-eyed water blobs that grumble: They lap up onto a shoreline and snatch back a girl-fish after she tries to swim away, they splash up onto the shore to drive back a little boy, who looks frightened, and they search for the girl-fish several times, they grumble and gather together to form a wall to lift a man up and onto an island but fail and fall back into the sea, and in a few other scenes they swim pass ships at sea and shake them. Huge sea-blue fish escape from an underwater aquarium and rise to the surface to become waves that churn up a typhoon and rain; a small girl runs along their backs, but is not injured. In one scene the girl rubs her head on a baby's forehead to heal it, leaving faint red ovals on his forehead and cheeks. During the healing, her fingers and toes change from 5 digits to 3 fingers and toes on each limb; afterward, she has 5 digits on each limb again. A small fish licks a drop of blood we see on a boy's thumb, instantly healing a small cut we cannot see. Several schools of giant fish accidentally break though the door of a vault and are caught in a potion in a stone basin that causes the fish to fly upward. Two shore scenes feature hundreds of insects in the foreground. A character opens a beer can which overflows. Alcohol is not consumed. A male human-looking character under the sea drinks elixirs from four tall bottles and from a fifth he pours a glowing golden potion and when he drinks the last drops from the bottle, he states, ""I can feel the power of it down into my DNA.""

A man is thrown about and is pinned by heavy furniture. A scary vulture attacks an elephant to take a flower from him. The mayor gets a stapler stuck to his head. Twice. While believing that the flower in question does not contain a world of people, a villain that is hired to destroy it promises his new boss that he will ""devour"" the flower, then ""regurgitate it"", and then ""devour it again"". (used for comedic effect) None. The ending is chaotic and somewhat violent. The voucher and his attack may be frightening to children. The Sour Kangaroo and Wickersham Brothers are very mean and frightening characters that will possibly scare some small children. In the audio commentary for one of the deleted scenes (on the special edition DVD and Blu-Ray), there is a mention of a literal ""asskicking machine""."

Little John disguises himself as a woman and hides a great deal of coins in his shirt, making him appear to have large breasts. A guard notices this and whistles at him. A badminton birdie briefly falls inside Lady Kluck's cleavage. As she is a bird, she shouldn't even have breasts. Klucky gets a wedgie near the end of the archery tournament. Little John says, ""Snatch his underwear"" during the song that humiliated Prince John. Skippy gets into a play fight with Lady Cluck and hits her foot with a toy sword. He worries briefly about whether he's hurt her for real, but he hasn't. The fight scenes during the archery tournament segment are done in a comedic matter and is tame. Prince John is sometimes violent towards Sir Hiss; he smashes a mirror on Hiss' head (no blood shown), fists his head to which Hiss responds 'thank you sir', ties him up against a post (in a comedic manner) and kicks Hiss on the head while sleeping and as discipline for Hiss for hissing in John's foot. Prince John is seen with a jug of wine. There is a scene where Sir Hiss (the snake) is shoved into a barrel by Friar Tuck (the badger) and Alan-A-Dale (the rooster) containing an alcoholic substance. Sir Hiss says he doesn't drink. He later appears intoxicated when Prince John lets him out of the barrel. A character's beheading is ordered and we see the rather sinister-looking headsman approaching with his axe, but the character is saved and nothing further happens. Children seen arguing. Many scenes with felonious activities (mostly adults, however children as well) Talk of hanging and dying. Noose seen being tied. Crossbow arrow is shot and flies around bouncing off wall/ground missing spooked characters. God bless, Thank God and Thank the Lord."

The Queen of Hearts says ""Off with his/her head!"" several times but we never see the acts take place. Mild cartoon action throughout. -G Various drug references. moderate smoking references The Caterpillar is seen smoking a hookah and the dodo bird carries a cigar. Alice breaks down and cries twice. When she cries in the woods it may make some kids sad. A character grooms, lures away, and then eats baby oysters whose shells resemble bonnets. The eating is not seen, but their empty shells are shown afterwards. Children may find the ""Very Good Advice"" song/scene very sad. Alice cries during and after. The flowers call Alice a ""Weed"" A bird calls Alice a ""Serpent"" Alice calls the Queen of Hearts a ""Fat, pompous, bad tempered, old tyrant"" There is no swearing, but there are a few insults throughout the movie"
